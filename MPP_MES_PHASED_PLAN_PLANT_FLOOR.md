---

## Purpose

This document is the phased delivery plan for **Arc 2 (Plant Floor MES)** — the operator-facing portion of the MPP MES replacement. It is the sibling of `MPP_MES_PHASED_PLAN_CONFIG_TOOL.md` (Arc 1), which is complete.

**Arc 1** built the Configuration Tool: the engineering-facing surface where plant, items, routes, BOMs, quality specs, and reference vocabularies (shifts, downtime codes, defect codes) are authored. Arc 1 is delivered across eight phases and ships 9 versioned migrations, 171 repeatable stored procedures, and 779 passing tests.

**Arc 2** builds the Plant Floor MES: the operator-facing surface that runs against Arc 1's configured master data. Its audiences are **shop-floor operators, supervisors, quality staff, and shipping staff**, interacting through Ignition Perspective touch terminals, barcode scanners, and PLC-integrated production machinery. Arc 2 captures LOT lifecycle from die-cast origination through containerized shipment to Honda, with traceable genealogy at every step.

This plan is unblocked with one explicit precondition: **Phase 0 (Customer Validation Gate) must complete before Phase 1 implementation begins.** Phase 0 is a facilitation workshop with MPP stakeholders that resolves four structural decisions whose wrong answer would force a phase rebuild.

## Architecture Pattern

Arc 1 used Ignition Named Queries calling stored procedures, with Perspective views as thin CRUD forms over the proc layer. Arc 2 builds on that architecture but adds two more layers, both of which are first-class in this plan:

**Ignition Gateway Scripts.** Many plant-floor events originate outside Perspective sessions: PLC tags change, OmniServer scales publish values, timers tick at shift boundaries, and external systems (AIM, Zebra printers) expect direct calls. These live in Ignition Gateway scripts — long-running background scripts that watch OPC tags, poll queues, and issue HTTP/SOAP calls. Gateway scripts call stored procs for DB work; they never execute DML directly.

**PLC/OPC Touchpoints.** Plant-floor workflows tangle with assembly PLC handshakes (MIP), scales (OmniServer), and vision systems (Cognex). This plan describes PLC touchpoints **functionally** — what tag is read, what is written, what the handshake semantics are — but defers bit-level OPC addresses and register maps to `reference/5GO_AP4_Automation_Touchpoint_Agreement.pdf` and FRS Appendix C.

The three layers compose as:

```
  Perspective View (touch UI)
       │         │
       │ (Named Query)           (Named Query)
       ▼         ▼                      ▼
  Stored Proc (SQL)   ◀─── calls ───  Gateway Script (Python)
                                          │        │
                                          ▼        ▼
                                     OPC/PLC   AIM / Zebra / etc.
```

Stored procs remain the authoritative write path — no Gateway script or Perspective binding performs DML directly. Every external I/O (AIM HTTP, Zebra socket write, OPC tag write-back) is bracketed with `Audit.Audit_LogInterface` calls so the external conversation is reconstructible forever.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Arc 1's conventions carry forward unchanged and apply to every Arc 2 proc. They are not repeated here; see `MPP_MES_PHASED_PLAN_CONFIG_TOOL.md` § Cross-Cutting Concerns. In summary: audit streams (ConfigLog, OperationLog, InterfaceLog, FailureLog), code-table-backed status everywhere, soft-delete via `DeprecatedAt` (never hard DELETE except where explicitly documented — `BomLine`, `RouteStep`), optimistic locking via `@RowVersion` on Update, `SortOrder` + `_MoveUp`/`_MoveDown` instead of drag-drop, BIGINT/NVARCHAR everywhere, single result set per proc (no OUTPUT parameters), `RAISERROR` in nested CATCH blocks (not `THROW`), user attribution via `@AppUserId BIGINT`.

Arc 2 adds the following eleven conventions. These are normative for every phase of this plan.

### B1 — Operator session context binding

Every Arc 2 mutation proc accepts both `@AppUserId BIGINT` and `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT` as required parameters. Procs validate both exist and are active (AppUser not deprecated, Terminal Location not deprecated, Location of type `Terminal`). On any rejection, `Audit.FailureLog` captures both values along with the attempted parameters.

Session lifecycle (inactivity timeout, re-auth for high-security actions, logout) is **enforced at the Ignition Perspective layer**, not in procs. Procs treat every call as equally authoritative; Perspective is responsible for ensuring the caller is authenticated and the session has not expired.

### B2 — `BlocksProduction` interlock discipline

Any proc that advances a LOT through the process — `Lot_MoveTo`, `ProductionEvent_Record`, `ConsumptionEvent_Record`, `Lot_Split`, `Lot_Merge`, `ContainerSerial_Add`, `Container_Create` — first calls the shared guard `Lots.Lot_AssertNotBlocked(@LotId)`. The guard reads `Lot.LotStatusId → LotStatusCode.BlocksProduction`. Any status with `BlocksProduction=1` (Hold, Scrap, Closed) trips the guard. A tripped guard is a **business rule violation**, not an exception: the caller receives `Status=0, Message='LOT 2026-04-06-0001 is in status Hold and cannot progress'`, the attempt is logged to FailureLog, and no partial writes occur.

The guard is delivered in Phase 1 (as part of the LOT core skeleton) and reused across all downstream phases.

### B3 — Open-event invariant

`Oee.DowntimeEvent` and `Quality.HoldEvent` both carry nullable `EndedAt` / `ReleasedAt` columns. The invariant: **at most one open event per resource at any time**. For `DowntimeEvent`, the resource is the machine `Location`; for `HoldEvent`, the resource is the `Lot` (or the optional `NonConformance`). `_Start` / `_Place` procs enforce the invariant with an explicit pre-check:

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Oee.DowntimeEvent
           WHERE LocationId = @LocationId AND EndedAt IS NULL)
BEGIN
    SET @Status = 0;
    SET @Message = CONCAT('Machine ', @LocationName, ' already has an open downtime event');
    -- log failure, return
END
```

Attempting a second open event is a business rule violation, not an exception. `_End` / `_Release` procs reject if no open event exists.

### B4 — Gateway script layer contract

Gateway scripts call stored procs the same way Perspective views do — through parameterized Named Queries. Gateway scripts **MUST NOT** execute raw DML via `system.db.runUpdateQuery` or inline SQL. External I/O (AIM HTTP/SOAP, Zebra printer socket writes, OPC read/write via TOPServer or OmniServer) happens **only** in Gateway scripts; stored procs never reach outside the database.

Every external call is bracketed by two `Audit.Audit_LogInterface` calls: one before the call (Direction='Outbound', RequestPayload populated, ResponsePayload NULL), one after (update the same row with ResponsePayload and any error). Critical failures are additionally logged to `Audit.FailureLog`. No outbox pattern — direct calls with a full audit trail (per OI-01 resolution).

### B5 — PLC descriptive boundary

Phase narratives describe what Gateway scripts read from and write to PLC tags in prose: tag names (e.g., `PartSN`, `PartValid`, `DataReady`, `HardwareInterlockEnable`, `CycleComplete`), semantics (edge-triggered vs. level-triggered), and handshake steps. **Bit-level OPC addresses, data types, register numbers, and PLC ladder logic stay out of this plan.** They live in `reference/5GO_AP4_Automation_Touchpoint_Agreement.pdf` and FRS Appendix C. Gateway script implementation references those documents; the plan references them by path.

### B6 — Print job contract

ZPL generation for labels (LTT, shipping label, master label) is assembled in Gateway scripts from a template file plus data returned by the originating stored proc. The stored proc (`LotLabel_Print`, `ShippingLabel_Print`, etc.) writes the audit row with the full rendered `ZplContent` and returns its Id; the Gateway script reads the Id, dispatches the ZPL content to the physical Zebra printer (via socket), and records the print acknowledgement back on the same row (not via a second insert). Void labels use `IsVoid=1` + `VoidedAt` + `VoidedByUserId`; rows are never deleted.

### B7 — Late-binding reason codes

`Oee.DowntimeEvent.DowntimeReasonCodeId` is **nullable**. When a PLC detects a machine stop before an operator classifies it, `DowntimeEvent_Start` inserts the row with NULL reason. `DowntimeEvent_End` succeeds with a NULL reason. Unclassified downtime is flagged on the shift-supervisor dashboard and on shift-end reporting — it is not blocked at proc level. A separate `DowntimeReasonCode_Assign` proc fills the reason later; it refuses to overwrite an already-assigned reason (supervisors must correct by other means).

### B8 — Genealogy traversal

`Lots.Lot_GetGenealogyTree(@LotId, @Direction)` uses a recursive CTE with `OPTION (MAXRECURSION 100)`. The `@Direction` parameter takes `'Ancestors'` (walk ParentLot → ParentLot → ...) or `'Descendants'` (walk children via `LotGenealogy`). Tree depth beyond 100 hops is a business rule violation with the message `genealogy tree exceeds supported depth of 100`. Real plant genealogy never approaches this bound; the cap is a defensive recursion guard.

### B9 — Test pattern extension for open-state events

Arc 1's test pattern covered mutations with a temp-table capture of the result shape (`Status / Message / NewId`). Arc 2 extends this for open-state events: after `_Start` / `_Place`, tests assert `EndedAt IS NULL` (or `ReleasedAt IS NULL`) directly against the underlying table:

```sql
DECLARE @OpenCount INT;
SELECT @OpenCount = COUNT(*)
FROM Oee.DowntimeEvent
WHERE LocationId = @LocationId AND EndedAt IS NULL;
IF @OpenCount <> 1
    RAISERROR('Expected exactly 1 open DowntimeEvent, got %d', 16, 1, @OpenCount);
```

After `_End` / `_Release`, tests assert the same row's `EndedAt IS NOT NULL`.

### B10 — Serial number migration audit

Deferred to Phase 0 decision on UJ-05. Once resolved (void-and-recreate **or** update-in-place with a new `Lots.ContainerSerialHistory` table), this convention is appended to the plan before Phase 6 starts, with the exact procs and write sequence for Sort Cage re-containerization.

### B11 — Zone-based default screen routing

On Perspective session startup, the client IP resolves to a Terminal-type `Location` row by querying its existing `IpAddress` `LocationAttribute`. The Terminal's zone (parent Area in the `Location` hierarchy) plus a new `DefaultScreen` `LocationAttributeDefinition` on the `Terminal` `LocationTypeDefinition` drives the initial Perspective view shown to any operator who logs in at that station.

A Trim Shop terminal opens to the Trim Station Screen; a Shipping Dock terminal opens to the Shipping Screen; a Die Cast terminal opens to the Die Cast LOT Entry Screen. Login itself (clock# + PIN) is orthogonal — the default-screen lookup happens on session start, before or alongside auth, per Phase 0's auth model outcome.

No DDL change is required. The `DefaultScreen` attribute is seeded as a new `LocationAttributeDefinition` row on the `Terminal` `LocationTypeDefinition` (via migration or via the existing Arc 1 Config Tool). Phase 1 delivers `Location.Terminal_GetByIpAddress` and the `Terminal_ResolveFromSession` Gateway script that stashes Zone + DefaultScreen in session props for the Home router view to consume.

## Stored Procedure Template and Conventions

Arc 2 procs follow the same template, error hierarchy, audit placement rules, and code-review checklist defined in `MPP_MES_PHASED_PLAN_CONFIG_TOOL.md` § Stored Procedure Template and Conventions. The template is reproduced in full there; it is not duplicated here. Cited fresh reminders:

- Three-tier error hierarchy (parameter validation → business rule → unexpected exception)
- `SET NOCOUNT ON; SET XACT_ABORT ON;` at top of every mutation proc
- Parameter validation and business-rule checks **before** `BEGIN TRANSACTION`; only the mutation wrapped in transaction
- Success audit call (`Audit.Audit_LogOperation` for Arc 2 plant-floor procs) **inside** the transaction, before `COMMIT`
- Failure audit call (`Audit.Audit_LogFailure`) outside transactions, in a nested TRY/CATCH around the failure-log insert so a failed audit-write cannot interfere with the primary rollback
- Final `SELECT @Status AS Status, @Message AS Message[, @NewId AS NewId];` on every exit path (no OUTPUT parameters — FDS-11-011)
- `RAISERROR` not `THROW` in nested CATCH blocks
- All DB references schema-qualified (`Lots.Lot`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation`)

One Arc 2 divergence: the primary audit sink for mutation procs is **`Audit.OperationLog`** (via `Audit.Audit_LogOperation`), not `Audit.ConfigLog` (via `Audit.Audit_LogConfigChange`). This is the core distinction between the two arcs. Config Tool mutations describe engineering-authored rules; Plant Floor mutations describe operator-observed events. The two audit streams are read by different supervisory queries.

**Direct dependency table:**

| Phase | Directly depends on | Unblocks |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | — | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 2, 8 |
| 2 | 1 | 3 |
| 3 | 1, 2 | 4, 5, 7 |
| 4 | 1, 2, 3 | 6 |

| 8 | 1 | — (parallel track) |

Phase 8 runs in parallel to Phases 2–7 as soon as Phase 1 lands. A small team can parallelize 4/5 (both depend only on 3) and can start 8 alongside 2.

---

# Phase 0 — Customer Validation Gate

**Goal:** Resolve four structural decisions whose wrong answer would force a phase rebuild in Arc 2, plus opportunistically close lower-risk open items.

**Dependencies:** None. Phase 0 blocks Phase 1 implementation but can run in parallel with Arc 1 post-delivery work.

**Status:** Unblocked. Requires MPP stakeholder availability for workshop facilitation.

## Data Model Changes

None directly — Phase 0 produces decisions, not DDL. Any DDL deltas flowing from Phase 0 decisions are captured in the Phase 1 migration (0010).

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

This phase **is** the open items phase. Its goal is to resolve:

**Gating (must resolve — wrong answer rebuilds a phase):**

| Item | Question | Why it gates |
|---|---|---|
| OI-06 / UJ-01 | Terminal session model — first-action vs shift-start login; inactivity timeout value; re-auth triggers; is zone-based auth substituted for clock# + PIN in some zones? | Phase 1 Login + Home router depend on the answer. Wrong answer forces Phase 1 rebuild. |
| UJ-10 | Shift boundary rules — how are open downtime events carried across? Partial containers? In-progress LOTs? Are `Shift.ActualStart`/`ActualEnd` adjusted for mid-shift breaks/lunch/overtime like the paper forms are? | Phase 1 (`Shift_Start`/`_End`) and Phase 8 (boundary ticker) cannot be built without this. |
| UJ-16 | `HardwareInterlockBypassed` flag location — on `ContainerSerial`, on `ProductionEvent`, or on both? What traceability do we need for a bypass? | Phase 6 Assembly depends on where the column lives. A late answer forces a Phase 6 schema + proc rewrite. |
| UJ-05 | Sort Cage serial migration pattern — void-and-recreate (new `SerializedPart` + new `ContainerSerial`) or update-in-place (mutate `ContainerSerial` with a new `Lots.ContainerSerialHistory` audit table)? | Phase 7 Sort Cage walk depends on the write shape. Update-in-place requires a new table (migration 0011 or similar). |

**Opportunistic (resolve if MPP available — fallbacks exist):**

| Item | Current fallback if unresolved |
|---|---|
| OI-02 / UJ-13 container closure | Count-based closure unless `Parts.ContainerConfig.ClosureMethod = 'Weight'` (NULL → count). |
| UJ-17 vision vs barcode confirmation | Barcode canonical; vision mismatch auto-holds LOT, supervisor override (per OI-04). |
| UJ-11 / UJ-19 paper-vs-real-time | Assume real-time at each station; if MPP chooses phased rollout, this is a deployment-order decision, not a design decision. |
| UJ-08 LOT merge rules | Deliver minimal `Lot_Merge` proc with hard-coded rules (same part, same die) in Phase 2; refactor to a configurable rule table post-MVP if required. |
| OI-10 tool life tracking | Track shot counts as `LocationAttribute` values on DieCastMachine-type locations. If MPP escalates, add a dedicated `Parts.Die` + `Parts.DieLifeEvent` table post-MVP. |

## State & Workflow

Phase 0 is a facilitated workshop, not a technical build. The workflow is:

1. **Pre-work.** Blue Ridge drafts a facilitator deck summarizing each gating item: the question, the candidate answers, the design implication of each answer, and Blue Ridge's recommended default. Deck distributed to MPP 3 business days before workshop.
2. **Workshop.** 2–3 hour session with MPP stakeholders (operations, quality, IT, production-control). Each gating item is walked, discussed, and decided. Opportunistic items covered if time permits. Every decision is logged in-room.
3. **Decision log capture.** Decisions appended to `MPP_MES_Open_Issues_Register.docx` with signed-off dates. Each decision references its OI/UJ number.
4. **Schema delta capture.** Any DDL additions (new columns, new attribute-definition rows, new code-table entries) are documented and folded into the Phase 1 migration file (`sql/migrations/versioned/0010_phase1_shop_floor_foundation.sql`).
5. **Plan convention update.** B10 (serial migration audit) is rewritten with the chosen pattern before Phase 6 starts.

## API Layer (Named Queries → Stored Procedures)

# Phase 1 — Shop Floor Foundation

**Goal:** Deliver the cross-cutting infrastructure that every downstream Arc 2 phase depends on — operator session, terminal binding, IP-based zone routing, shift runtime, LOT core skeleton, and the shared operation-log audit contract.

**Dependencies:** Phase 0 (customer validation gate) complete. Arc 1 SQL complete (all tables referenced exist, Audit procs operational).

**Status:** Blocked on Phase 0.

## Data Model Changes

**Migration `sql/migrations/versioned/0010_phase1_shop_floor_foundation.sql`:**

- Seed new `Location.LocationAttributeDefinition` rows on the `Terminal` `LocationTypeDefinition`:
  - `DefaultScreen` (NVARCHAR — Perspective route path, e.g., `'/shop-floor/trim-station'`)
  - `IdleTimeoutSeconds` (INT — inactivity timeout, default 300)
  - `RequiresReauthForSensitive` (BIT — default 1 — used by Perspective layer)
- Seed any DDL deltas captured in Phase 0. If UJ-10 resolves to a rule-coded approach, add a small `Oee.ShiftBoundaryCarryoverRuleCode` code table (3 seeded rows: `CloseAtEnd`, `CarryOpen`, `AssociateWithStartShift`) and reference it from `Oee.ShiftSchedule` as a nullable FK. If UJ-10 resolves to a single project-wide rule, skip the code table and hard-code the behavior in `Shift_End`.
- Add `Location.Location.IpAddress`-attribute-index if missing (read-heavy lookup in `Terminal_GetByIpAddress`).
- Seed a fallback `Terminal` `Location` row representing the global default (used when an unregistered IP connects).

**Tables used (all exist from Arc 1):**

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `Location.Location` | Terminal location lookup by IP |
| `Location.LocationAttribute` | `IpAddress`, `DefaultScreen`, `IdleTimeoutSeconds` values per Terminal |
| `Location.LocationAttributeDefinition` | Definition of new Terminal attributes |
| `Location.AppUser` | Authenticated user identity |
| `Oee.ShiftSchedule` | Active-shift resolver input |
| `Oee.Shift` | Runtime shift instances (append-only) |
| `Lots.Lot` | LOT header — minimal CRUD only in this phase |
| `Lots.LotStatusHistory` | Append on status change |
| `Lots.LotMovement` | Append on move |
| `Lots.LotStatusCode` | `BlocksProduction` flag source |
| `Audit.OperationLog` | Destination for all plant-floor mutation audit calls |
| `Audit.FailureLog` | Destination for rejected calls |

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

| Item | Assumption used |
|---|---|
| OI-06 auth model | Resolved in Phase 0 — the exact values (timeout seconds, re-auth triggers, zone override) feed `LocationAttribute` seed rows. |
| UJ-10 shift boundary | Resolved in Phase 0 — carryover rule drives the `Shift_End`/`Shift_Start` implementation. |
| UJ-01 zone-based auth | If Phase 0 confirms zone-based auth, a `Terminal.RequiresAuth` attribute overrides clock# + PIN prompting. Fallback: always require auth. |

## State & Workflow

### Session establishment (terminal startup)

An Ignition Perspective session starts when a Perspective client connects to the Gateway. The Gateway invokes the `Terminal_ResolveFromSession` script with the client's IP.

1. Gateway calls `Location.Terminal_GetByIpAddress(@IpAddress = '10.12.7.34')`.
2. Proc queries `Location.LocationAttribute` for `AttributeName = 'IpAddress' AND Value = @IpAddress`, joins to the parent `Location` row (which must be `LocationType = 'Terminal'`), and returns:
   - `TerminalLocationId` (the Terminal Location's Id)
   - `TerminalName` (Location.Name — e.g., `'DC-TERM-05'`)
   - `ZoneLocationId` + `ZoneName` (the Terminal's parent Area — e.g., `'Die Cast'`)
   - `DefaultScreen` (from `LocationAttribute`, e.g., `'/shop-floor/die-cast-entry'`)
   - `IdleTimeoutSeconds` (from `LocationAttribute`, e.g., `300`)
   - `RequiresReauthForSensitive` (from `LocationAttribute`, default `1`)
3. If no Terminal matches the IP, proc returns the fallback Terminal's attributes (seeded in migration 0010). The Gateway script flags the session as "unregistered terminal" and routes to a generic Login screen.
4. Gateway stashes these values in Perspective session props: `session.custom.terminal.*`.
5. Perspective's Home router view reads `session.custom.terminal.defaultScreen` and navigates to that path.

No DB mutation during session establishment. No audit log — this is a read-only lookup.

### Operator login (clock# + PIN)

Phase 0 decides whether login happens on first-action or at shift-start, and whether some zones bypass login. Assume for this narrative: first-action login, per OI-06's 2026-04-09 decision.

1. Operator touches the Perspective screen's first action (e.g., "Scan LTT").
2. If `session.custom.user.appUserId` is NULL, Perspective navigates to the Login modal.
3. Operator enters clock# on the numeric pad, then PIN.
4. Perspective calls the `AppUser_AuthenticateByClockAndPin` Named Query.
5. Proc `Location.AppUser_AuthenticateByClockAndPin` validates:
   - Clock# exists on an active (non-deprecated) `AppUser`.
   - PIN matches (Phase 0 may select AD-managed vs MES-managed PIN storage; assume hashed local storage as fallback).
6. On success, proc returns `AppUserId`, `FullName`, and the user's role list. No audit log — authentication events are logged by Ignition's own audit system.
7. On failure, proc returns `Status=0, Message='Invalid clock number or PIN'` and logs to `Audit.FailureLog` with `LogEventType = 'LoginRejected'`.
8. Perspective stashes `session.custom.user.*` and resumes the originally-attempted action.

### Session inactivity timeout

Every Perspective action (touch, scan, key) resets a session-level timer. If the timer exceeds `session.custom.terminal.idleTimeoutSeconds` without activity, Perspective clears `session.custom.user.*` and routes back to the Home router (which may or may not immediately prompt login, depending on the screen and Phase 0 decisions).

### Re-auth for high-security actions

Actions marked high-security in Perspective (place hold, release hold, scrap LOT, void shipping label) trigger a modal re-authentication before the action proceeds. On success, the action continues with the same `AppUserId`; the session is not "re-opened," it's a per-action authentication confirmation. No DB state change from re-auth — the Perspective layer enforces it.

### Shift runtime

Shift boundaries are driven by a Gateway script tick (`ShiftBoundaryTicker`, runs every 60 seconds):

1. Ticker calls `Oee.Shift_GetActive(@LocationId, @NowUtc)`.
2. Proc looks up `Oee.ShiftSchedule` rows active on today's day-of-week (per `DaysOfWeekBitmask`) with `EffectiveFrom <= @NowUtc` and `DeprecatedAt IS NULL`. Returns the one matching the current time-of-day window.
3. Ticker also calls `Oee.Shift_GetOpen(@ShiftScheduleId)` to see if there's an open `Shift` row for this schedule.
4. If the active schedule has no open `Shift` row, ticker calls `Oee.Shift_Start(@ShiftScheduleId, @ActualStart = @NowUtc)`. Proc inserts the Shift row, logs OperationLog.
5. If the previously-active schedule has an open `Shift` row but the active schedule is different (i.e., boundary crossed), ticker calls `Oee.Shift_End(@ShiftId, @ActualEnd = @NowUtc)` on the outgoing Shift. Proc updates the row, logs OperationLog.
6. UJ-10 carryover rule (resolved Phase 0) drives whether open `DowntimeEvent` rows are closed at shift end or carried forward.

### LOT core skeleton

Phase 1 delivers minimal LOT procs — enough to let Phase 3 (Die Cast) create its first LOT. Full LOT lifecycle (`Lot_Update`, `Lot_UpdateAttribute`, genealogy) is Phase 2.

`Lot_Create` flow (narrated from Phase 3's perspective — the proc is delivered here):

1. Operator scans a fresh LTT barcode. Perspective builds the parameter set: `@LotName` (barcode), `@ItemId`, `@LotOriginTypeId` (Manufactured), `@CurrentLocationId` (machine), `@PieceCount`, `@AppUserId`, `@TerminalLocationId`.
2. Proc validates parameters (no NULLs, FKs resolve).
3. Proc validates business rules: `@LotName` is unique across all `Lot` rows; `@Item` is eligible at `@CurrentLocationId` (joins to `Parts.ItemLocation` with `DeprecatedAt IS NULL`); piece count within `Parts.Item.MaxLotSize`.
4. `BEGIN TRANSACTION`.
5. Proc inserts `Lots.Lot` row with `LotStatusId` = 'Good' and returns the new `Id` as `@NewId`.
6. Proc inserts `Lots.LotStatusHistory` row: `OldStatusId = NULL`, `NewStatusId = 'Good'`, `ChangedByUserId = @AppUserId`, `TerminalLocationId = @TerminalLocationId`.
7. Proc calls `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` with `LogEntityTypeCode='Lot'`, `LogEventTypeCode='LotCreated'`, `EntityId=@NewId`, `Description='Created LOT <LotName> at <LocationName>'`.
8. `COMMIT`.
9. Final `SELECT @Status, @Message, @NewId`.

If any validation fails, no transaction opens, `Audit.Audit_LogFailure` is called with the attempted parameters, and the proc returns early.

### `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` shared guard

Procedure called by every downstream proc that advances a LOT:

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE Lots.Lot_AssertNotBlocked
    @LotId BIGINT,
    @Status BIT = NULL OUTPUT,   -- NOT USED — for future compat
    @Message NVARCHAR(500) = NULL OUTPUT
AS
-- Returns one of:
--   SELECT 1 AS IsBlocked, 'LOT <name> is in status <status> and cannot progress' AS Message;
--   SELECT 0 AS IsBlocked, NULL AS Message;
```

Callers read the `IsBlocked` flag. This is an **internal proc** (no audit, no FailureLog); callers that receive `IsBlocked=1` log their own rejection via FailureLog and return early.

## API Layer (Named Queries → Stored Procedures)

### Location — Terminal resolution

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Location.Terminal_GetByIpAddress` | `@IpAddress NVARCHAR(45)` | Reads `LocationAttribute` where `AttributeName='IpAddress'`; joins to parent Terminal Location and its parent Area. Returns fallback Terminal if no match. Falls back gracefully, never errors on unknown IP. | `Location.Location`, `Location.LocationAttribute`, `Location.LocationType`, `Location.LocationTypeDefinition` | Perspective session start, via Gateway script | Rowset: `TerminalLocationId, TerminalName, ZoneLocationId, ZoneName, DefaultScreen, IdleTimeoutSeconds, RequiresReauthForSensitive` |
| `Location.Terminal_List` | (none) | Admin query — all Terminal-type Locations with attributes. Used by an admin screen (not operator-facing). | `Location.Location`, `Location.LocationAttribute` | Admin browsing Terminal inventory | Rowset per Terminal |

### AppUser — operator authentication

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Location.AppUser_AuthenticateByClockAndPin` | `@ClockNumber NVARCHAR(20)`, `@Pin NVARCHAR(20)`, `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT` | Validates against active `AppUser` rows. Hashed PIN compare. On failure, logs `FailureLog` with `LogEventType='LoginRejected'`, `@TerminalLocationId` in AttemptedParameters. No audit on success (Ignition audits logins separately). | `Location.AppUser`, `Audit.Audit_LogFailure` | First-action login at terminal | Single row: `Status BIT, Message NVARCHAR(500), AppUserId BIGINT, FullName NVARCHAR(200)`. `AppUserId` NULL on failure. |
| `Location.AppUser_GetRoles` | `@AppUserId BIGINT` | Returns the role list for this user. If Phase 0 selects AD-sourced roles, the proc delegates to a cached AD snapshot table populated by a Gateway script; if Phase 0 selects local roles, the proc reads directly from `Location.AppUser`-linked role tables. Used by Perspective to gate screen visibility. | `Location.AppUser`, AD cache (if applicable) | On successful auth, cached in session | Rowset of role names |

### Shift — runtime instances

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Oee.Shift_Start` | `@ShiftScheduleId BIGINT`, `@ActualStart DATETIME2(3)`, `@Remarks NVARCHAR(500) NULL`, `@AppUserId BIGINT`, `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT` | Inserts a new `Oee.Shift` row. Rejects if an open Shift (ActualEnd NULL) already exists for this ShiftSchedule (per B3). Logs `OperationLog` with `LogEventType='ShiftStarted'`. | `Oee.Shift`, `Oee.ShiftSchedule`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Gateway ShiftBoundaryTicker | `Status, Message, NewId` |
| `Oee.Shift_End` | `@ShiftId BIGINT`, `@ActualEnd DATETIME2(3)`, `@Remarks NVARCHAR(500) NULL`, `@AppUserId BIGINT`, `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT` | Closes the Shift: updates `ActualEnd`. Rejects if ActualEnd already set (per B3). Logs `OperationLog` with `LogEventType='ShiftEnded'`. UJ-10 carryover logic (closing or carrying open DowntimeEvents) is applied here based on the Phase 0 decision. | `Oee.Shift`, `Oee.DowntimeEvent`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Gateway ShiftBoundaryTicker or manual override | `Status, Message` |
| `Oee.Shift_GetActive` | `@LocationId BIGINT` (optional — for location-specific schedule filtering), `@NowUtc DATETIME2(3) = SYSDATETIME()` | Returns the schedule active at `@NowUtc` matching the day-of-week bitmask. Does not create a Shift row. | `Oee.ShiftSchedule` | Gateway ShiftBoundaryTicker; supervisor dashboard | Single row: `ShiftScheduleId, ShiftScheduleName, StartTime, EndTime, DaysOfWeekBitmask` or empty |
| `Oee.Shift_GetOpen` | `@ShiftScheduleId BIGINT` | Returns the open Shift (if any) for this schedule. Used by the ticker to detect whether a Shift_Start is needed. | `Oee.Shift` | Gateway ShiftBoundaryTicker | Single row: `ShiftId, ActualStart` or empty |

### Lot — core skeleton (minimal; Phase 2 expands)

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Lots.Lot_Create` | `@LotName NVARCHAR(50)`, `@ItemId BIGINT`, `@LotOriginTypeId BIGINT`, `@CurrentLocationId BIGINT`, `@PieceCount INT`, `@Weight DECIMAL(10,4) NULL`, `@WeightUomId BIGINT NULL`, `@DieNumber NVARCHAR(50) NULL`, `@CavityNumber INT NULL`, `@VendorLotNumber NVARCHAR(100) NULL`, `@MinSerialNumber NVARCHAR(100) NULL`, `@MaxSerialNumber NVARCHAR(100) NULL`, `@AppUserId BIGINT`, `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT` | Creates a Lot with status 'Good'. Validates uniqueness of `@LotName`, `Item` eligibility at `@CurrentLocationId` (via `Parts.ItemLocation`), piece count ≤ `Parts.Item.MaxLotSize`. Inserts initial `LotStatusHistory` row. Audit via `Audit.Audit_LogOperation`. Phase 2 expands for origin-specific validation. | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotStatusHistory`, `Parts.Item`, `Parts.ItemLocation`, `Lots.LotOriginType`, `Lots.LotStatusCode`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Phase 3+ station produces a new LOT | `Status, Message, NewId` |
| `Lots.Lot_Get` | `@LotId BIGINT NULL`, `@LotName NVARCHAR(50) NULL` (one required) | Returns the Lot row. Empty result set = not found (per FDS-11-011). | `Lots.Lot` | Any screen displaying a LOT | Single row of Lot columns |
| `Lots.Lot_List` | `@ItemId BIGINT NULL`, `@CurrentLocationId BIGINT NULL`, `@LotStatusId BIGINT NULL`, `@LimitRows INT = 100` | Filterable listing. Read-only, no audit. | `Lots.Lot` | LOT search screen | Rowset of Lot columns |
| `Lots.Lot_UpdateStatus` | `@LotId BIGINT`, `@NewLotStatusId BIGINT`, `@Reason NVARCHAR(500) NULL`, `@AppUserId BIGINT`, `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT`, `@RowVersion ROWVERSION` | Updates `Lot.LotStatusId` with optimistic-lock check. Inserts `LotStatusHistory` row. Rejects no-op (new = current). Phase 2 extends — Phase 1 only accepts Good → Closed transitions as preparation for Phase 7 hold logic. | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotStatusHistory`, `Lots.LotStatusCode`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Phase 2+ for general transitions; Phase 7 for holds | `Status, Message` |
| `Lots.Lot_MoveTo` | `@LotId BIGINT`, `@ToLocationId BIGINT`, `@AppUserId BIGINT`, `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT` | Updates `Lot.CurrentLocationId` and inserts `LotMovement` row with `FromLocationId` = prior value, `ToLocationId` = new. Calls `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` first (per B2). | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotMovement`, `Lots.Lot_AssertNotBlocked`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Any station that receives a scanned LOT | `Status, Message` |
| `Lots.Lot_AssertNotBlocked` | `@LotId BIGINT` | Internal shared guard. Returns `IsBlocked BIT, Message NVARCHAR(500)`. No audit. Called by every advancing proc (B2). | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotStatusCode` | Every mutation that advances a LOT | Single row: `IsBlocked BIT, Message NVARCHAR(500)` |

### Audit — shared operation logger (may already exist from Arc 1; verify)

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | `@AppUserId BIGINT`, `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT`, `@LocationId BIGINT NULL` (context location), `@LogSeverityCode NVARCHAR(20) = 'Info'`, `@LogEventTypeCode NVARCHAR(100)`, `@LogEntityTypeCode NVARCHAR(50)`, `@EntityId BIGINT`, `@Description NVARCHAR(1000)`, `@OldValue NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL`, `@NewValue NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL` | Inserts into `Audit.OperationLog`. Resolves code strings to FK ids internally. Returns no result set (per JDBC refactor — audit writers silent). | `Audit.OperationLog`, code-resolver internals | Every Arc 2 mutation proc | (none) |

## Gateway Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Trigger | External System | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Terminal_ResolveFromSession` | On Perspective session start, read client IP, call `Terminal_GetByIpAddress`, stash Terminal/Zone/DefaultScreen/IdleTimeout/RequiresReauth into `session.custom.terminal.*`. If unregistered IP, fall back to global-default Terminal and flag the session. | Perspective session startup event | — | — (read-only) |
| `SessionIdleWatcher` (Perspective view-side script, not Gateway) | Per-view inactivity detector. Resets on any interaction. On timeout, clears `session.custom.user.*` and navigates to Home. | Perspective interaction events | — | — |
| `ShiftBoundaryTicker` | Every 60 seconds: for each configured schedule, resolve active schedule, detect boundary crossings, call `Shift_End` on outgoing + `Shift_Start` on incoming. Also applies UJ-10 carryover rule to open DowntimeEvents. | Gateway timer (60s) | — | Interface log on any downtime-carryover decision |
| `AdAuthenticator` | If Phase 0 selects AD-based PIN storage, this script validates clock# + PIN against AD LDAP; otherwise local hashed storage via the proc. Returns the AD user's roles. | `AppUser_AuthenticateByClockAndPin` call (indirect) | Active Directory (optional) | `InterfaceLog` with `SystemName='AD'` |

## Perspective Views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Login (modal) | Clock# numeric pad + PIN pad. Submits `AppUser_AuthenticateByClockAndPin`. Shows inline error on failure. Logout button persistent in session header. |
| Terminal Selector | Shown only for unregistered-IP sessions. Operator selects terminal from a list or scans a terminal barcode. Updates `session.custom.terminal.*` from a manual selection proc. |
| Home Router | Stateless: reads `session.custom.terminal.defaultScreen` and navigates. Falls back to a generic Home tile grid if DefaultScreen is NULL. Not a user-visible screen in normal operation — it's a routing pass-through. |
| Session Timeout Modal | Shown on inactivity timeout. Offers "Continue" (requires re-auth) or "Logout" (clears session). |
| Re-Auth Modal | Triggered by high-security actions. Clock# + PIN inline, confirms `@AppUserId` for the specific action; does not change the outer session. |

## Test Coverage

New test suite at `sql/tests/0013_PlantFloor_Foundation/` with files:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `010_Terminal_GetByIpAddress.sql` | Known IP resolves to correct Terminal + Zone + DefaultScreen; unknown IP returns fallback; Terminal without DefaultScreen attribute returns NULL DefaultScreen; deprecated Terminal not returned. |
| `020_AppUser_Authenticate.sql` | Valid clock+PIN returns AppUserId; invalid PIN rejects with FailureLog entry; deprecated AppUser rejects; missing clock# rejects. |
| `030_Shift_lifecycle.sql` | `Shift_Start` creates row; `Shift_Start` rejects when open Shift exists (B3); `Shift_End` closes row; `Shift_End` rejects when no open Shift; `Shift_GetActive` returns schedule by day-of-week bitmask; `Shift_GetOpen` returns open Shift if one exists. |
| `040_Lot_Create.sql` | Valid manufacture creates Lot + LotStatusHistory; duplicate `LotName` rejects; ineligible Item-at-Location rejects; piece count over `MaxLotSize` rejects; missing `@AppUserId` rejects. |
| `050_Lot_Get_List.sql` | `Lot_Get` by Id and by LotName; empty result for non-existent; `Lot_List` filters work; limit applied. |
| `060_Lot_UpdateStatus.sql` | Valid transition applies; stale `@RowVersion` rejects; no-op (same status) rejects; invalid target status rejects. |
| `070_Lot_MoveTo.sql` | Valid move updates CurrentLocationId + inserts LotMovement; move from unblocked Lot succeeds; move from blocked Lot (Hold/Scrap/Closed) rejects via `Lot_AssertNotBlocked`. |
| `080_Lot_AssertNotBlocked.sql` | Good returns `IsBlocked=0`; Hold/Scrap/Closed return `IsBlocked=1` with correct Message; non-existent Lot returns `IsBlocked=1` with 'LOT not found' message. |

# Phase 2 — LOT Lifecycle Completion

**Goal:** Fill out the complete LOT surface — all mutation procs, append-only history streams, full genealogy (split/merge/consumption), and label reprint — so downstream operator-station phases compose from a stable LOT API.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (foundation). No new table DDL; all tables exist in data model v1.5.

**Status:** Blocked on Phase 1.

## Data Model Changes

No DDL changes expected. Phase 2 indexes any hot-read paths exposed by testing (e.g., `Lots.LotGenealogy(ParentLotId)` and `Lots.LotGenealogy(ChildLotId)` may need explicit indexes if not already present). Index additions roll into migration `0011_phase2_lot_lifecycle.sql`.

**Tables used (all exist from Arc 1):**

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `Lots.Lot` | Header — expanded update surface |
| `Lots.LotStatusHistory` | Append on every `Lot_UpdateStatus` |
| `Lots.LotMovement` | Append on every `Lot_MoveTo` |
| `Lots.LotAttributeChange` | Append on every `Lot_UpdateAttribute` |
| `Lots.LotGenealogy` | Append on Split / Merge / Consumption |
| `Lots.GeneologyRelationshipType` | Code table — Split, Merge, Consumption |
| `Lots.LotLabel` | Append on every label print/reprint |
| `Lots.PrintReasonCode` | Code table — Initial, ReprintDamaged, Split, Merge, SortCageReIdentify |
| `Lots.LabelTypeCode` | Code table — Primary, Container, Master, Void |

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

| Item | Fallback |
|---|---|
| UJ-08 merge rules | Ship with hard-coded rule: `Lot_Merge` requires same `ItemId` and same `DieNumber`. If MPP demands configurability, a `Lots.MergeRule` table is added post-MVP. |
| B10 serial migration | Not yet relevant — Phase 6 consumes this. Confirm B10 is finalized before Phase 6 starts. |

## State & Workflow

### Full `Lot_Update`

`Lot_Update` is distinct from `Lot_UpdateStatus`. It covers mutations to LOT header fields other than status — piece count correction, weight correction, operator-entered die/cavity correction, vendor-lot-number correction for received LOTs. Each field change is captured as a separate `LotAttributeChange` row so the before/after audit is field-level.

1. Perspective sends the full LOT payload with the operator's intended new values.
2. Proc validates optimistic lock via `@RowVersion`.
3. Proc validates `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` (per B2 — even "corrections" on a held LOT are not allowed; release the hold first).
4. Proc compares each mutable field. For each changed field:
   - Insert `LotAttributeChange` row with `AttributeName`, `OldValue`, `NewValue`, `ChangedByUserId`, `TerminalLocationId`, `ChangedAt`.
5. Update the `Lot` row with the new values; `UpdatedByUserId`, `UpdatedAt`, `RowVersion` auto-updated.
6. Audit via `Audit_LogOperation` with `LogEventType='LotUpdated'`, a description summarizing the field count changed, and `Changes` JSON attached.

### Genealogy — three shapes

**Split.** One parent LOT becomes multiple child LOTs. Parent piece count drops to 0 (or residual — e.g., a 48-piece parent splits into two 24-piece children, parent goes to 0 and status → Closed; if sorting splits out 12 suspect pieces from a 48-piece parent, parent goes to 36 with status Good, child LOT carries 12 and can be scrapped separately).

`Lot_Split` sequence (delivered in this phase, consumed by Phase 5 Machining and Phase 7 Sort Cage):

1. Parameter validation, `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` on the parent.
2. Business rule: sum of child piece counts ≤ parent piece count.
3. For each child spec in the payload:
   - Call `Lot_Create` with `ParentLotId = @ParentLotId`, origin-type = same as parent (the child is still Manufactured if the parent was Manufactured).
   - Capture the new child Lot Id.
   - Insert a `LotGenealogy` row: `ParentLotId`, `ChildLotId`, `RelationshipTypeId = 'Split'`, `PieceCount` = the child's share, `EventUserId`, `TerminalLocationId`.
4. Reduce parent piece count by the total split quantity via `Lot_UpdateAttribute`. If residual is 0, `Lot_UpdateStatus` on parent → `Closed`.
5. Audit via `Audit_LogOperation` with `LogEventType='LotSplit'`, description listing child LotNames.
6. Return child Lot Ids as a rowset (not as `@NewId` — many children).

**Merge.** Multiple source LOTs combine into one output. Per UJ-08, merge rules are hard-coded in this MVP (same Item, same Die). Output LOT carries the sum of source piece counts.

`Lot_Merge` sequence:

1. Parameter validation: ≥2 source LOTs listed.
2. `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` on each source.
3. Business rule (hard-coded): all sources share `ItemId` and `DieNumber`.
4. Create the merged output via `Lot_Create` (origin = same as sources).
5. For each source:
   - Insert `LotGenealogy` row: `ParentLotId = sourceId`, `ChildLotId = outputId`, `RelationshipTypeId = 'Merge'`, `PieceCount = source's contribution`.
   - `Lot_UpdateStatus` source → `Closed` (all pieces migrated to the output).
6. Audit with `LogEventType='LotMerged'`.
7. Return output Lot Id.

**Consumption.** One or more source LOTs are consumed to produce a child LOT or to fill a serialized part's container. Handled by `LotGenealogy_RecordConsumption` in this phase (low-level) and invoked by Phase 6's `ConsumptionEvent_Record` (higher-level).

`LotGenealogy_RecordConsumption` is narrow: given a source LOT, a produced LOT or container tray position, and a piece count, insert the `LotGenealogy` row with `RelationshipTypeId='Consumption'`. Phase 6 wires this into the Assembly workflow with surrounding validation (BOM check, interlock bypass handling, container-tray placement).

### Genealogy traversal

`Lot_GetGenealogyTree` walks the graph recursively. Given a starting LOT, the `@Direction` parameter selects:

- `'Ancestors'` — walk upward via `Lot.ParentLotId` (for direct parent chain) AND via `LotGenealogy.ChildLotId = current` (to find MERGE-parents). Return distinct ancestors.
- `'Descendants'` — walk downward via `LotGenealogy.ParentLotId = current`. Return all children, grandchildren, etc., with their relationship types.
- `'Both'` — union of Ancestors and Descendants.

Depth bound: `OPTION (MAXRECURSION 100)` (per B8). The returned rowset includes depth, relationship type, and whether each node is still active (`DeprecatedAt IS NULL`).

### Label reprint

`LotLabel_Reprint` captures a new `LotLabel` row with a `PrintReasonCode` explaining why a reprint was needed (label damaged, LOT attribute corrected, split generated a new child LTT, merge issued a new parent). The original `LotLabel` row is not modified — labels are append-only. Perspective's reprint dialog forces a reason selection; the Gateway ZPL dispatcher renders and prints as with `LotLabel_Print`.

### Attribute edits audit

Every mutation to a mutable LOT field — piece count, weight, die, cavity, vendor lot number — produces a `LotAttributeChange` row. This is the traceability backbone for Honda audits: years later, every field's history is queryable. `Lot_GetAttributeHistory` walks this and is used by the LOT detail screen's "history" tab.

## API Layer (Named Queries → Stored Procedures)

### Lot — expanded mutations

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Lots.Lot_Update` | `@LotId BIGINT`, `@PieceCount INT NULL`, `@Weight DECIMAL(10,4) NULL`, `@WeightUomId BIGINT NULL`, `@DieNumber NVARCHAR(50) NULL`, `@CavityNumber INT NULL`, `@VendorLotNumber NVARCHAR(100) NULL`, `@RowVersion ROWVERSION`, `@AppUserId`, `@TerminalLocationId` | Full header update.

| `Lots.Lot_UpdateAttribute` | `@LotId BIGINT`, `@AttributeName NVARCHAR(50)`, `@NewValue NVARCHAR(500)`, `@AppUserId`, `@TerminalLocationId` | Single-field update helper. Mostly used by internal callers (Lot_Split reducing parent piece count). Field-validation against an allow-list. | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotAttributeChange`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Internal from Lot_Split, Lot_Merge, Trim weight adjustment | `Status, Message` |
| `Lots.Lot_Split` | `@ParentLotId BIGINT`, `@ChildrenJson NVARCHAR(MAX)` (JSON array of `{pieceCount, currentLocationId, dieNumber?, cavityNumber?}`), `@AppUserId`, `@TerminalLocationId` | Creates N child LOTs, inserts SPLIT `LotGenealogy` rows, reduces parent piece count, closes parent if residual=0. Rejects if sum(children) > parent. `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` on parent. | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotGenealogy`, `Lots.Lot_Create`, `Lots.Lot_UpdateAttribute`, `Lots.Lot_UpdateStatus`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Phase 5 Machining OUT, Phase 7 Sort Cage | Rowset of child Lot rows (Id, LotName, PieceCount) + leading `Status, Message` row (shape: results multiplexed — see note) |
| `Lots.Lot_Merge` | `@SourceLotIdsJson NVARCHAR(MAX)` (JSON array of source Lot Ids), `@OutputItemId BIGINT`, `@OutputLocationId BIGINT`, `@AppUserId`, `@TerminalLocationId` | Combines sources into one output. Hard-coded rule: same Item, same Die. Closes all sources. Inserts MERGE `LotGenealogy` rows. `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` on each source. | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotGenealogy`, `Lots.Lot_Create`, `Lots.Lot_UpdateStatus`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Operator-initiated merge (rare; MVP) | `Status, Message, NewId` (output Lot Id) |

Called from Phase 6 `ConsumptionEvent_Record`. Not called directly from Perspective. | `Lots.LotGenealogy`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Internal from Phase 6 | `Status, Message, NewId` (genealogy row Id) |

**Note on `Lot_Split` result shape:** Because `Lot_Split` creates N children, the natural return is a rowset of child rows. To keep FDS-11-011 (single result set) intact, `Lot_Split` returns a single result set with columns: `Status BIT, Message NVARCHAR(500), ChildLotId BIGINT, ChildLotName NVARCHAR(50), PieceCount INT`. On failure, one row with Status=0 and NULL child columns. On success, N rows all with Status=1 and child fields populated. Callers iterate the result set.

Target: 80–100 passing tests in suite 0014.

## Phase 2 complete when

- [ ] Migration `0011_phase2_lot_lifecycle.sql` applied (indexes for genealogy hot paths if needed).
- [ ] All repeatable procs for Lot full mutations, genealogy, and labels present and current.
- [ ] All tests in `sql/tests/0014_PlantFloor_LotLifecycle/` pass (target 80–100).
- [ ] `LttZplDispatcher` Gateway script dispatches to a dev Zebra printer and captures ack.
- [ ] Perspective LOT Search, Detail, Genealogy Tree Viewer, and Reprint Dialog implemented and manually smoke-tested.
- [ ] End-to-end: operator creates a LOT in Phase 1's stub flow, edits the piece count on the Detail screen, splits it into two children, prints a reprint — all audit rows correct.

# Phase 3 — Die Cast Operator Station

**Goal:** Deliver the first end-to-end producer workflow — a Die Cast machine operator scans a fresh LTT, enters production data, records rejects, and prints the LTT label. Implements the FDS-03-017a data-collection capture contract end to end.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (session, LOT core), Phase 2 (LotLabel_Print helper).

**Status:** Blocked on Phases 1–2.

## Data Model Changes

**Migration `sql/migrations/versioned/0012_phase3_die_cast.sql`:**

- Seed any missing `Audit.LogEventType` rows used by Phase 3 procs: `ProductionRecorded`, `Rejected`, `LotLabelPrinted` (most already exist from Arc 1 — verify and seed any gaps).
- Seed dev test rows in `Parts.OperationTemplate` + `Parts.OperationTemplateField` representing a minimal Die Cast operation (`DieCastShot`) with required DataCollectionFields: `DieIdentifier`, `CavityNumber`, `WeightValue`, `GoodCount`, `NoGoodCount`, `WarmupShotCount` (UJ-14). Seed data lives in `sql/seeds/seed_operation_templates_die_cast.sql`.
- If OI-10 tool life is resolved Phase 0 as a `LocationAttribute` on the DieCastMachine type, seed the attribute definition (`ShotsSinceLastChange`, `MaxShotsPerTool`). Otherwise, no-op.

**Tables used:**

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `Lots.Lot` | New LOT created per shot batch |
| `Lots.LotStatusHistory`, `Lots.LotMovement`, `Lots.LotAttributeChange` | Append-only side effects |
| `Lots.LotLabel` | LTT print record |
| `Workorder.ProductionEvent` | One row per event — hot columns captured |
| `Workorder.ProductionEventValue` | Child rows for non-hot DataCollectionFields |
| `Workorder.RejectEvent` | Reject count per defect code |
| `Parts.OperationTemplate`, `Parts.OperationTemplateField`, `Parts.DataCollectionField` | Drives what the UI asks for and what gets captured |
| `Parts.Item`, `Parts.ItemLocation` | Eligibility check |
| `Quality.DefectCode` | Reject defect assignment |
| `Audit.OperationLog`, `Audit.FailureLog` | Audit destinations |

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

| Item | Fallback |
|---|---|
| OI-10 tool life | If unresolved, shot counts captured in `ProductionEventValue` as a DataCollectionField; no running total maintained; supervisor queries history on demand. If Phase 0 chose LocationAttribute approach, `ProductionEvent_Record` increments the `ShotsSinceLastChange` attribute. |
| UJ-14 warm-up shots | Warm-up shots captured as a `DataCollectionField` on the DieCastShot operation template (`WarmupShotCount` field value on `ProductionEventValue`). Separately, when a setup-type `DowntimeEvent` is closed, Phase 8's `DowntimeEvent_End` captures the accumulated warm-up shots on `DowntimeEvent.ShotCount`. |
| UJ-11 paper-vs-real-time | Assume real-time. If MPP phases rollout, this station ships first; others follow. Design unchanged. |

## State & Workflow

### Die Cast LOT creation walkthrough

Carlos is running DC machine #7, part 5G0, die #42, cavity B. The basket has 48 good parts and 3 rejects from the last shot cycle.

1. Perspective session is already on the Die Cast LOT Entry screen (DefaultScreen for this terminal, set by Phase 1 routing).
2. Carlos peels a pre-printed LTT sticker off the stack. It has a barcode, e.g., `2026-04-06-0001`, already printed. He sticks it on the basket.
3. He taps the barcode input on the screen and scans the LTT with the station's USB scanner. Perspective's scan binding sets a `lttBarcode` input field.
4. The screen reveals the data entry form. It pulls the active OperationTemplate for Die Cast at this machine (Perspective calls `OperationTemplate_GetActiveForLocation(@LocationId)` — a read proc from Arc 1). The form dynamically renders the fields configured on the template:
   - `DieIdentifier` (text, required)
   - `CavityNumber` (int, required)
   - `WeightValue` (decimal, optional)
   - `GoodCount` (int, required, default 0)
   - `NoGoodCount` (int, required, default 0)
   - `WarmupShotCount` (int, optional, default 0)
5. Carlos enters `Die=42`, `Cavity=B`, `GoodCount=48`, `NoGoodCount=0`.
6. He submits. Perspective calls `ProductionEvent_Record` with the full payload.
7. `ProductionEvent_Record` (narrative below) creates the Lot, writes the ProductionEvent, writes any ProductionEventValue children, and returns `Status=1, Message='OK', NewLotId=<id>, NewProductionEventId=<id>`.
8. Perspective then calls `LotLabel_Print` (from Phase 2) with the pre-rendered ZPL for the LTT, which logs the label and returns a `LotLabelId`.
9. Perspective hands the ZPL + LotLabelId to the `LttZplDispatcher` Gateway script. Script dispatches to the station's Zebra printer. On success, script calls `LotLabel_ConfirmPrint(@LotLabelId)` (internal — may just update `PrintedAt` on the row).
10. The LTT prints beside Carlos. He sticks it on the basket next to the fresh LTT and wheels it out of die cast.

### `ProductionEvent_Record` — the contract

This is the FDS-03-017a capture proc. It is the single write path for production data at any operator station. Phase 3 delivers it with Die-Cast-specific test coverage; Phases 4–6 exercise it at other stations without additional proc work.

Signature (conceptual):

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE Workorder.ProductionEvent_Record
    @LotId BIGINT NULL,              -- NULL => create Lot first
    @LotName NVARCHAR(50) NULL,      -- Required if @LotId is NULL
    @ItemId BIGINT NULL,             -- Required if @LotId is NULL
    @LotOriginTypeCode NVARCHAR(50) NULL, -- Required if @LotId is NULL; typically 'Manufactured'
    @LocationId BIGINT,              -- Machine where event occurred
    @OperationTemplateId BIGINT,     -- Drives DataCollectionField validation
    @DieIdentifier NVARCHAR(50) NULL,
    @CavityNumber INT NULL,
    @WeightValue DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
    @WeightUomId BIGINT NULL,
    @GoodCount INT,
    @NoGoodCount INT,
    @Remarks NVARCHAR(500) NULL,
    @DataCollectionValuesJson NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,  -- Array of {fieldName, value, numericValue?, uomId?}
    @AppUserId BIGINT,
    @TerminalLocationId BIGINT
```

Execution sequence:

1. Parameter validation:
   - If `@LotId IS NULL`, `@LotName`, `@ItemId`, `@LotOriginTypeCode` must all be present (creating a new LOT).
   - If `@LotId IS NOT NULL`, the LOT must exist and `@ItemId` must match (or be NULL for identity check).
   - `@LocationId`, `@OperationTemplateId`, `@AppUserId`, `@TerminalLocationId` all required and exist.
2. Business rule: `@Item` is eligible at `@LocationId` (`Parts.ItemLocation`).
3. Business rule: `@OperationTemplate` is active (not deprecated) and its `LocationId` matches `@LocationId`'s Area (or is `NULL` meaning universal).
4. `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` if `@LotId` is provided.
5. Validate `@DataCollectionValuesJson`:
   - Parse the JSON.
   - For every field on `Parts.OperationTemplateField` for this operation: if `IsRequired=1`, the field must appear in the JSON OR be captured by a hot column (`GoodCount`, `NoGoodCount`, `DieIdentifier`, `CavityNumber`, `WeightValue`). Missing required → reject.
   - For every field in the JSON: it must exist on `Parts.DataCollectionField` AND be configured for this OperationTemplate (`Parts.OperationTemplateField`). Otherwise reject.
   - Duplicate fields in JSON → reject.
   - A JSON field that duplicates a hot column (e.g., JSON contains `GoodCount`) → reject with a clear "use the hot parameter" message.
6. `BEGIN TRANSACTION`.
7. If `@LotId IS NULL`: call `Lot_Create` with the LOT parameters. Capture `@LotId` from the returned `NewId`.
8. Insert the `ProductionEvent` row with hot columns + `OperationTemplateId` + `@AppUserId` + `@TerminalLocationId` + `RecordedAt = SYSDATETIME()`. Capture `@NewProductionEventId`.
9. For each field in `@DataCollectionValuesJson`: insert `ProductionEventValue` row with `ProductionEventId = @NewProductionEventId`, `DataCollectionFieldId`, `Value`, `NumericValue` (if the field's data-type is numeric), `UomId` (if applicable).
10. If `@NoGoodCount > 0` and no corresponding `RejectEvent` was passed explicitly, mirror pattern: Phase 3 lets the operator enter rejects in a separate call (`RejectEvent_Record`), so `ProductionEvent_Record` writes the count but does NOT create a RejectEvent automatically. The operator enters defect codes in a follow-on action.
11. Update the `Lot` — `PieceCount` increments by `@GoodCount` (or is set to `@GoodCount` for a newly-created Lot), `CurrentLocationId = @LocationId`.
12. Audit via `Audit_LogOperation` with `LogEventType='ProductionRecorded'`, description includes `GoodCount`, `NoGoodCount`, and LotName.
13. `COMMIT`.
14. Final `SELECT @Status=1, @Message='OK', @NewLotId, @NewProductionEventId`.

### `RejectEvent_Record`

The operator enters rejects as a follow-on action from the Die Cast screen — separate call, separate transaction. This keeps the primary production event small and lets rejects be entered repeatedly (multiple defect codes per reject batch).

1. Validate params: `@LotId` exists, `@DefectCodeId` exists, `@Quantity > 0`, `@ProductionEventId` (optional) exists and belongs to `@LotId`.
2. `Lot_AssertNotBlocked`.
3. Insert `Workorder.RejectEvent` row with `LotId`, `DefectCodeId`, `Quantity`, `ChargeToArea`, `ProductionEventId` (nullable — rejects without event-binding allowed).
4. Audit with `LogEventType='Rejected'`, description includes defect code and quantity.
5. Return `Status, Message, NewId`.

Rejects do NOT change the LOT's piece count — the rejects were never "in" the LOT's count to begin with (FRS Section 4). The operator can also choose not to enter rejects at every step (FRS: reject recording is optional).

### Die Cast shot counts (UJ-14)

Warm-up shots are captured via `WarmupShotCount` DataCollectionField on the DieCastShot template. The value lands on `ProductionEventValue`. A separate warm-up shots accumulator on `DowntimeEvent.ShotCount` — populated in Phase 8 when a Setup-type downtime event closes — captures the total per setup episode, useful for OEE.

### Tool life tracking (OI-10 contingent)

If Phase 0 resolves OI-10 as a `LocationAttribute` approach: `ProductionEvent_Record` optionally increments `ShotsSinceLastChange` on the machine's `LocationAttribute` row after a successful production event (if the attribute exists for this machine type). If threshold crossed (`>= MaxShotsPerTool`), Perspective shows a tool-change alert. No new proc needed — a helper call to the Arc 1 `LocationAttribute_SetValue` proc does the increment.

If Phase 0 chose a dedicated `Parts.Die` table, that work is scoped as a separate mini-phase post-MVP; Phase 3 ships unchanged.

## API Layer (Named Queries → Stored Procedures)

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Workorder.ProductionEvent_Record` | See signature above | The FDS-03-017a capture proc. Creates a LOT if needed, writes the event + values, increments piece count, audits. Optional tool-life increment. | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.Lot_Create`, `Workorder.ProductionEvent`, `Workorder.ProductionEventValue`, `Parts.OperationTemplate`, `Parts.OperationTemplateField`, `Parts.DataCollectionField`, `Parts.Item`, `Parts.ItemLocation`, `Location.LocationAttribute` (tool life optional), `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Any producer station | `Status, Message, NewLotId, NewProductionEventId` |

Per FDS-11-011 single result set, return a flattened rowset one row per value + header column carried. Or return header-only here and use `ProductionEventValue_List` for the children. Choose the latter. | `Workorder.ProductionEvent` | LOT detail drill-down | Single header row |
| `Workorder.ProductionEventValue_List` | `@ProductionEventId BIGINT` | All value rows for a single event. | `Workorder.ProductionEventValue`, `Parts.DataCollectionField` | LOT detail, event drill-down | Rowset: `FieldName, Value, NumericValue, Uom` |

## Gateway Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Trigger | External System | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LttZplDispatcher` (already delivered Phase 2) | Reused — Phase 3 invokes it after a successful `ProductionEvent_Record` + `LotLabel_Print` pair. | After `LotLabel_Print` returns | Zebra printer | `InterfaceLog` |
| `DieCastShotCountReader` (optional — OI-10 contingent) | If PLC exposes a shot-count tag, this script reads it on cycle-complete edge and calls `LocationAttribute_SetValue` to update `ShotsSinceLastChange`. Descriptive: reads `ShotCount` tag from DC PLC, writes to LocationAttribute. | PLC `CycleComplete=1` edge | PLC (TOPServer) | — (logged in Audit.OperationLog via the proc) |

## Perspective Views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Die Cast LOT Entry | Scanner-driven touch layout. Barcode scan binds to `@LotName`. Form renders from active OperationTemplate. Submits to `ProductionEvent_Record` + `LotLabel_Print`. |
| Reject Entry (inline panel on Die Cast screen) | DefectCode picker filtered to Die Cast area. Quantity entry. Submits to `RejectEvent_Record`. |
| Production Event History (modal on LOT Detail) | Lists events for a LOT via `ProductionEvent_List`; drill into each event for its ProductionEventValue rows via `ProductionEventValue_List`. |

## Test Coverage

New test suite at `sql/tests/0015_PlantFloor_DieCast/`:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `010_ProductionEvent_Record_happy_path.sql` | Creates Lot + event + values; increments piece count; audits correctly. |
| `020_ProductionEvent_Record_existing_lot.sql` | Adds event to existing Lot; piece count increments. |
| `030_ProductionEvent_Record_validation.sql` | Missing required DataCollectionField rejects; unknown field rejects; duplicate hot-field-in-JSON rejects; ineligible Item rejects; blocked Lot rejects. |
| `040_ProductionEvent_Record_templates.sql` | Deprecated OperationTemplate rejects; active OperationTemplate accepts; template tied to wrong Area rejects. |
| `050_RejectEvent_Record.sql` | Valid reject creates row; invalid defect code rejects; negative quantity rejects; blocked Lot rejects; Lot piece count unchanged. |
| `060_ProductionEvent_List_Get.sql` | Filter by Lot, Location, date range works; Get returns single row; ProductionEventValue_List returns child rows. |
| `070_Tool_life_increment.sql` (if OI-10 LocationAttribute) | Increments `ShotsSinceLastChange`; reset via `LocationAttribute_SetValue` works. |

Target: 100–140 passing tests in suite 0015 (the proc is large; many validation branches).

# Phase 4 — Movement + Trim + Receiving

**Goal:** Composite phase covering three operator station patterns that share a single mechanic: scan a LOT and either move it, adjust its piece count (weight-based at Trim), or create a received LOT (Receiving).

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (Lot_MoveTo, session), Phase 2 (LotAttributeChange audit), Phase 3 (ProductionEvent_Record reused at Trim).

**Status:** Blocked on Phases 1–3.

## Data Model Changes

**Migration `sql/migrations/versioned/0013_phase4_movement_trim_receiving.sql`:**

- Seed dev `Parts.OperationTemplate` rows for `TrimShopOperation` and `ReceivingInspection` with appropriate `OperationTemplateField` entries.
- Seed any `Audit.LogEventType` rows for `LotMoved` (already from Phase 1), `LotReceived`, `WeightReconciled` (add any gaps).
- Seed a new `LocationAttributeDefinition` row on the Trim Shop Machine type for `PrimaryScale` (NVARCHAR — OPC tag path of the station's scale).

**Tables used:**

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `Lots.Lot` | Updated via move, weight reconciliation, or new received LOT |
| `Lots.LotMovement`, `Lots.LotAttributeChange`, `Lots.LotStatusHistory` | Append streams |
| `Workorder.ProductionEvent` / `ProductionEventValue` | Captures Trim production (weight snapshot, piece count before/after) |
| `Parts.Item.UnitWeight` | Source for weight-to-count conversion |
| `Parts.OperationTemplate`, `Parts.OperationTemplateField` | Trim / Receiving templates |
| `Location.LocationAttribute` | Scale OPC tag path per Trim station |
| `Audit.OperationLog`, `Audit.InterfaceLog` (scale reads) | Audit |

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

| Item | Fallback |
|---|---|
| OI-02 / UJ-13 closure weight on containers | Not consumed at Trim directly; Trim reads weight but does not close containers. Deferred to Phase 6. |
| UJ-11 paper-vs-real-time | Real-time assumed. |

## State & Workflow

### Movement Scan Screen — reusable pattern

Almost every station that receives a LOT needs a move-scan entry point. Rather than build a different one per station, Phase 4 delivers a generic `Movement Scan Screen` that any terminal can route to. It takes:

1. Scan LTT barcode.
2. Perspective calls `Lot_Get(@LotName = scannedBarcode)`.
3. On found: `Lot_AssertNotBlocked`, then call `Lot_MoveTo(@LotId, @ToLocationId = session.custom.terminal.terminalLocationId, @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)`. On success, LOT's `CurrentLocationId` is now the terminal's Location.
4. Screen flips to station-specific mode — Trim UI, Machining IN UI, Assembly receive UI — driven by the terminal's zone.
5. On not-found or blocked: show clear error, beep, log to FailureLog.

Phase 4 delivers the Movement Scan Screen as a Perspective embedded view; each station's screen embeds it at the top and renders station-specific content below after a successful scan.

### Trim Shop — weight-based piece count

The operator sets the basket on the scale. OmniServer publishes `ScaleWeight` on the station's OPC tag. A Gateway script reads the tag on a debounced-stable signal and posts the weight to the Perspective session as a live binding.

1. Operator scans LTT at the Trim terminal. Movement Scan Screen fires `Lot_MoveTo` (Die Cast → Trim Shop); the Trim UI opens.
2. UI shows: current LOT's piece count, current item's `UnitWeight`, the live scale weight.
3. UI computes: `derivedPieceCount = round(netWeight / unitWeight)`. Operator reviews the derived count vs. current piece count. Per FRS 2.2.3, they can update the count; MES takes no further action on the discrepancy but logs the change.
4. Operator submits the trim-out action. Perspective calls `ProductionEvent_Record`:
   - `@LotId = existingLotId`
   - `@LocationId = trimStationLocationId`
   - `@OperationTemplateId = TrimShopOperation`
   - `@WeightValue = netWeight`, `@WeightUomId = LB or KG uom Id`
   - `@GoodCount = derivedPieceCount` (or operator-overridden)
   - `@NoGoodCount = 0` (Trim does not reject in MVP — sorter cage is separate)
   - `@DataCollectionValuesJson` includes any TrimShopOperation-specific fields (e.g., `NetWeight`, `PriorPieceCount`, `TareWeight`)
5. `ProductionEvent_Record` writes the event, writes ProductionEventValue rows, updates the Lot's piece count to the new count (which records a `LotAttributeChange` row for the before/after), and moves the Lot's `CurrentLocationId` to the Trim station.

The weight-to-count helper is a small proc used by the UI for its live binding (not in the transactional write path):

```
Lots.Lot_WeightToPieceCount(@ItemId, @NetWeightValue, @NetWeightUomId)
    → returns @DerivedPieceCount, assuming linear unit weight;
      errors if Item.UnitWeight is NULL or UOM mismatch.
```

### Receiving Dock — pass-through parts

A truck arrives with 500 units of 6MA Cam Holder housings. The receiving operator has a packing slip with vendor lot number `VND-88721`.

1. Operator is at the Receiving Dock terminal (DefaultScreen = Receiving Dock Screen).
2. Receiving Dock Screen: scan Item barcode (part number), enter vendor lot number, enter piece count, select origin type (`Received` or `ReceivedOffsite` for remote-receiving per UJ-06).
3. Submit. Perspective calls `Lot_CreateReceived`:

```
Lots.Lot_CreateReceived(
    @ItemId, @VendorLotNumber, @PieceCount,
    @MinSerialNumber NULL, @MaxSerialNumber NULL,
    @CurrentLocationId = receivingDockLocationId,
    @LotOriginTypeCode = 'Received' | 'ReceivedOffsite',
    @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)
```

4. Proc validates: vendor-lot-number not duplicate across open received lots for this Item; piece count positive; `@LotOriginTypeCode` in allowed set.
5. Proc generates a `LotName` internally — convention: `RCV-<YYYYMMDD>-<nnnn>` — and calls `Lot_Create` (Phase 1) with the generated name. Received LOTs don't carry LTT stickers peeled from the pre-printed stack; the MES generates the LTT on creation and prints it.
6. After Lot creation, Perspective calls `LotLabel_Print` with a Received-style ZPL template and dispatches to the Receiving Dock Zebra.
7. Audit via `Audit_LogOperation` with `LogEventType='LotReceived'`.

**Off-site receiving** uses the same `Lot_CreateReceived` proc over VPN — no code difference per UJ-06 resolution. The off-site operator's terminal just has a different `IpAddress` and `DefaultScreen`.

### Supplier-identified serial ranges

For received LOTs where the supplier has pre-numbered parts in a contiguous serial range, `@MinSerialNumber` and `@MaxSerialNumber` are populated. These feed into Phase 6 Assembly's consumption logic — an assembled output serial that consumes a piece from a received LOT can record `ConsumedSerialNumber` if traceable. Phase 4 captures the range; Phase 6 uses it.

## API Layer (Named Queries → Stored Procedures)

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Lots.Lot_WeightToPieceCount` | `@ItemId BIGINT`, `@NetWeightValue DECIMAL(10,4)`, `@NetWeightUomId BIGINT` | Helper (read-only). Converts weight to derived count using `Item.UnitWeight`. Errors (empty result) if UnitWeight NULL or UOM unit mismatch. | `Parts.Item`, `Parts.Uom` | Live UI binding at Trim | Single row: `DerivedPieceCount INT, UnitWeight DECIMAL, UnitWeightUomName` |
| `Lots.Lot_CreateReceived` | `@ItemId BIGINT`, `@VendorLotNumber NVARCHAR(100)`, `@PieceCount INT`, `@MinSerialNumber NVARCHAR(100) NULL`, `@MaxSerialNumber NVARCHAR(100) NULL`, `@CurrentLocationId BIGINT`, `@LotOriginTypeCode NVARCHAR(50)` (Received or ReceivedOffsite), `@AppUserId`, `@TerminalLocationId` | Wraps `Lot_Create` with the received-LOT semantics. Generates `LotName` as `RCV-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`. Validates vendor-lot uniqueness for this Item within the active (non-deprecated) set. | `Lots.Lot_Create`, `Lots.LotOriginType`, `Parts.Item`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Receiving Dock Screen | `Status, Message, NewLotId, NewLotName` |
| `Lots.Lot_ScanAtStation` | `@LotName NVARCHAR(50)`, `@StationLocationId BIGINT`, `@AppUserId BIGINT`, `@TerminalLocationId BIGINT` | Thin wrapper combining `Lot_Get` + `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` + `Lot_MoveTo`. Used by the Movement Scan Screen. One round-trip to DB instead of three. Returns the LOT's details on success. | `Lots.Lot_Get`, `Lots.Lot_AssertNotBlocked`, `Lots.Lot_MoveTo`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Every station with a scan entry | Single row: `Status, Message, LotId, LotName, ItemCode, ItemName, PieceCount, LotStatusCode` |

**Note:** `ProductionEvent_Record` (Phase 3) is the write path for Trim's weight/count capture; no new proc needed. Phase 4 contributes an `OperationTemplate` seed for Trim and the `PrimaryScale` LocationAttribute definition.

## Gateway Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Trigger | External System | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ScaleTagReader` | Per Trim station, watches the `PrimaryScale` OPC tag (OmniServer publisher path). Debounces stability. Pushes live weight to the session's Perspective client for the Trim binding. Does not call any proc directly — writes only to session props. | OPC tag change event | OmniServer (scale publisher) | `InterfaceLog` once per read session; not per-sample |
| `ReceivingZplDispatcher` | Variant of `LttZplDispatcher` for received LOTs — different ZPL template. May be merged with the base dispatcher via a template-type parameter. | Called after `Lot_CreateReceived` | Zebra printer at Receiving Dock | `InterfaceLog` |

## Perspective Views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Movement Scan Screen (reusable embedded view) | Scan LTT → `Lot_ScanAtStation` → station UI opens. |
| Trim Station Screen | Embeds Movement Scan. Shows current LOT, UnitWeight, live scale weight, derived piece count. Submits to `ProductionEvent_Record`. |
| Receiving Dock Screen | Part-number scan + vendor-lot entry + count + origin-type selector. Submits to `Lot_CreateReceived`. Prints LTT on success. |
| Off-Site Receiving Screen (VPN) | Same as Receiving Dock Screen with the `ReceivedOffsite` origin-type preset. |

## Test Coverage

New test suite at `sql/tests/0016_PlantFloor_Movement_Trim_Receiving/`:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `010_Lot_ScanAtStation.sql` | Happy path: scan-and-move; blocked LOT rejects; unknown LotName rejects; moves to current location is a no-op (allowed). |
| `020_Lot_WeightToPieceCount.sql` | Valid weight → count; NULL UnitWeight rejects; UOM mismatch rejects. |
| `030_Lot_CreateReceived.sql` | Creates LOT with `Received` or `ReceivedOffsite` origin; auto-generates LotName; vendor-lot uniqueness enforced per Item; invalid origin code rejects. |
| `040_ProductionEvent_at_Trim.sql` | `ProductionEvent_Record` at a Trim OperationTemplate accepts weight + derived count; LotAttributeChange captures piece count before/after; Lot moves to Trim station. |
| `050_Received_lot_serial_range.sql` | `@MinSerialNumber` / `@MaxSerialNumber` persisted; range validation (Min ≤ Max) on create. |

Target: 60–80 passing tests in suite 0016.

# Phase 5 — Machining with Sub-LOT Split

**Goal:** Deliver the Machining station's two-touch IN/OUT workflow, auto-split mechanics with operator override, FIFO queue with manual override, and reject capture for out-of-tolerance pieces.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (foundation), Phase 2 (`Lot_Split`), Phase 3 (`ProductionEvent_Record`, `RejectEvent_Record`), Phase 4 (Movement Scan pattern).

**Status:** Blocked on Phases 1–3. Phase 4 parallel — can run after Phase 3 independently.

## Data Model Changes

**Migration `sql/migrations/versioned/0014_phase5_machining.sql`:**

- Seed `Parts.OperationTemplate` rows for `MachiningIn` and `MachiningOut` with appropriate DataCollectionFields (`Fixture`, `Program`, `CycleTimeSeconds`, etc. — final set confirmed with MPP).
- Seed any missing `Audit.LogEventType` rows: `MachiningInScanned`, `LotSplit` (already from Phase 2 likely), `MachiningOutCompleted`.

**Tables used:** No new tables. Leverages existing `Lots.Lot`, `LotGenealogy`, `ProductionEvent`, `RejectEvent`.

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

| Item | Fallback |
|---|---|
| UJ-03 sub-LOT split auto vs manual | Phase 0 resolved to auto-split with operator override. Fallback if unresolved: auto-split at `DefaultSubLotQty`, operator confirms or edits. |

## State & Workflow

### FIFO queue semantics

Each Machining Area has an arrival-ordered queue of LOTs awaiting machining. The queue is populated by `Lot_MoveTo` events whose destination is a Machining Area (or a specific Machining machine, depending on how MPP partitions the queue).

`Lot_GetWipQueueByLocation` returns the LOTs at the given location in ascending `LastMovementAt` order. Perspective's Machining IN screen shows this queue; the operator can select any LOT from it (not just the first). When they select a non-first LOT, Perspective prompts "this is not the oldest LOT — continue?" to nudge FIFO compliance without enforcing it (per FRS 2.2.4).

### Machining IN — arrival capture

1. Operator at a CNC machine scans the LTT of an incoming basket.
2. Perspective calls `Lot_ScanAtStation` (Phase 4). LOT moves to this machine's Location (specific machine, not the Machining Area — basket is now at machine).
3. UI opens the Machining IN screen. It shows the LOT, the active MachiningIn OperationTemplate, any prompt fields (e.g., `Fixture`, `Program`).
4. Operator fills the form and submits. Perspective calls `ProductionEvent_Record` with `@OperationTemplateId = MachiningIn`, `@GoodCount = 0` (no production yet — this is an arrival marker), `@NoGoodCount = 0`.
5. `ProductionEvent_Record` writes the event with the operator's captured fields in `ProductionEventValue` (fixture, program, etc.). The LOT's `PieceCount` does not change.
6. Audit as `MachiningInScanned`.

### Machining OUT — completion with auto-split

The machine runs. Parts come off. Operator counts good + bad.

1. At OUT, operator scans LTT. `Lot_ScanAtStation` verifies still-at-this-machine (or re-establishes if machine was used elsewhere in between).
2. UI opens Machining OUT screen. It shows `GoodCount`, `NoGoodCount` inputs.
3. Operator fills: e.g., `GoodCount=48`, `NoGoodCount=1`.
4. UI also presents the split preview: given `Parts.Item.DefaultSubLotQty = 24` for this Item, the split-preview shows "Creates 2 sub-LOTs of 24 each".
5. Operator reviews. They can:
   - **Accept auto-split** — default action. Submit proceeds with 2×24 split.
   - **Edit split quantities** — e.g., change to `[20, 28]` or `[48]` (no split) before submitting.
   - **Cancel split** — skip the split; LOT stays whole. Flagged visually.
6. Operator submits. Perspective calls the composite `MachiningOut_Record` proc:

```
Workorder.MachiningOut_Record(
    @ParentLotId, @LocationId, @OperationTemplateId,
    @GoodCount, @NoGoodCount,
    @SplitChildrenJson NULL | JSON array of {pieceCount, currentLocationId},
    @DataCollectionValuesJson,
    @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)
```

7. `MachiningOut_Record` executes:
   - Call `ProductionEvent_Record` (internal) with the MachiningOut operation. This writes the event + values, increments the parent's piece count by `@GoodCount` — wait, clarification: at Machining, `GoodCount` is a through-count, the piece is already in the LOT and being processed. Treat the Machining out event as a pass-through, not an increment: set `@PieceCount` behavior on `ProductionEvent_Record` based on the OperationTemplate type. Option: a flag on `OperationTemplate` (`IsPieceCountIncrement`) that says whether this template adds pieces (Die Cast = yes) or passes them through (Machining = no). Phase 3's `ProductionEvent_Record` honors this flag; Phase 5 seeds MachiningIn / MachiningOut with `IsPieceCountIncrement=0`.
   - If `@NoGoodCount > 0`, record is captured on the event; operator can enter defect codes via follow-on `RejectEvent_Record` calls (same as Die Cast).
   - If `@SplitChildrenJson` present and non-empty: call `Lot_Split` (Phase 2) to create the children. Each child's `@CurrentLocationId` is the same Machining machine (they'll move elsewhere later via scan). Parent is reduced; if residual=0, parent goes to Closed.
8. Audit via `Audit_LogOperation` with `LogEventType='MachiningOutCompleted'`, description includes child counts.
9. Return `Status, Message, ProductionEventId, ChildLotIds[]` (one row per child, Phase 2's multi-row pattern).

### Reject capture at Machining

Same as Die Cast — separate `RejectEvent_Record` call after the main OUT event. The operator selects defect codes from a Machining-Area-filtered DefectCode picker (e.g., `MS-OOT-01 Dimensional`, `MS-TOOLMARK-02`).

### LOT selection from queue — override

If the operator picks a non-first LOT from the queue, the Perspective confirmation dialog captures an optional reason. The captured reason is written to the MachiningIn ProductionEvent's `ProductionEventValue` as a `QueueOverrideReason` field. Enables later supervisor analysis of override patterns.

### Rework LOTs

Machining may process a rework LOT returning from Sort Cage (Phase 7). Rework LOTs appear in the queue if their `CurrentLocationId` is a Machining location. No special handling — they look identical in the queue.

## API Layer

| Procedure | Parameters | Notes | Dependencies | Executed When | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Lots.Lot_GetWipQueueByLocation` | `@LocationId BIGINT`, `@IncludeChildren BIT = 0` (for Machining Area instead of specific machine) | Returns queue ordered by `LastMovementAt ASC`. Read-only. `@IncludeChildren=1` descends to child Locations (an Area sums its Machines). | `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotMovement`, `Location.Location` | Machining IN screen | Rowset: Lot fields + `ArrivedAt`, `HoldFlag` (from BlocksProduction) |
| `Workorder.MachiningOut_Record` | See narrative above | Composite: calls `ProductionEvent_Record` (internal) + optional `Lot_Split`. Single transaction. | `Workorder.ProductionEvent_Record`, `Lots.Lot_Split`, `Audit.Audit_LogOperation` | Machining OUT screen | Multi-row rowset: header row with `Status, Message, ProductionEventId`; additional rows for each child LOT |

**Note:** `ProductionEvent_Record` receives a small upgrade in Phase 5: honors `Parts.OperationTemplate.IsPieceCountIncrement` flag. If 0, does not increment `Lot.PieceCount` on the parent. Phase 3 deliverable gets this flag added in the Phase 3 proc source; migration 0012 (Phase 3) seeds `DieCastShot.IsPieceCountIncrement=1`; migration 0014 (Phase 5) seeds MachiningIn / MachiningOut with `IsPieceCountIncrement=0`.

That flag needs a column in `Parts.OperationTemplate` — which means a retroactive DDL addition:

**Migration `0014_phase5_machining.sql` also adds:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE Parts.OperationTemplate
    ADD IsPieceCountIncrement BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
```

and backfills seed rows (`DieCastShot`=1, `TrimShopOperation`=1, `MachiningIn`=0, `MachiningOut`=0, `ReceivingInspection`=0).

## Gateway Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Trigger | External System | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MachiningCycleReader` (optional — per machine integration) | Reads `CycleComplete` edge from PLC, stamps a cycle-time value onto the active ProductionEvent via a helper proc. Optional — operator can enter cycle time manually. | PLC tag edge | PLC (TOPServer) | — |

## Perspective Views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Machining IN | Queue list (calls `Lot_GetWipQueueByLocation`); scan-or-pick flow; operator selects a LOT, fills MachiningIn template fields, submits `ProductionEvent_Record`. Override-reason prompt on non-FIFO selection. |
| Machining OUT | Shows the LOT at this machine. Inputs: GoodCount, NoGoodCount, template fields. Split preview panel (rendered from `Item.DefaultSubLotQty`) with accept/edit/cancel options. Submits `MachiningOut_Record`. After success: child LTTs print via `LttZplDispatcher`. Reject entry inline. |

## Test Coverage

New test suite at `sql/tests/0017_PlantFloor_Machining/`:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `010_Lot_GetWipQueueByLocation.sql` | Queue returned in arrival order; `@IncludeChildren=1` covers child Locations; blocked LOTs flagged. |
| `020_MachiningOut_Record_no_split.sql` | Single LOT through (no split); ProductionEvent written; parent LOT piece count unchanged (IsPieceCountIncrement=0). |
| `030_MachiningOut_Record_with_split.sql` | Split 48 → [24, 24]; parent closed; 2 SPLIT genealogy rows; 2 child LOTs created at same machine. |
| `040_MachiningOut_Record_partial_split.sql` | Split 48 → [20, 28]; parent at 0 (closed); 2 children with correct counts. |
| `050_MachiningOut_Record_cancel_split.sql` | No split (whole LOT progresses); parent stays open; no SPLIT genealogy rows. |
| `060_MachiningOut_Record_validation.sql` | Over-split (children > parent) rejects; blocked parent rejects; deprecated OperationTemplate rejects; missing `@SplitChildrenJson` when auto-split expected is allowed (accept-default). |
| `070_IsPieceCountIncrement_flag.sql` | DieCastShot increments piece count; MachiningIn/Out do not; TrimShopOperation's behavior confirmed. |

Target: 60–90 passing tests in suite 0017.

## Phase 5 complete when

- [ ] Migration `0014_phase5_machining.sql` applied; `IsPieceCountIncrement` column added; MachiningIn/MachiningOut templates seeded.
- [ ] `Lot_GetWipQueueByLocation` and `MachiningOut_Record` procs delivered; `ProductionEvent_Record` updated to honor `IsPieceCountIncrement`.
- [ ] All tests in `sql/tests/0017_PlantFloor_Machining/` pass.
- [ ] Perspective Machining IN and Machining OUT screens implemented with split preview UI.
- [ ] End-to-end: Die Cast LOT scanned at Machining IN → machined → MachiningOut with split produces two child LTTs on dev Zebra; parent auto-closes when residual=0.

# Phase 6 — Assembly + MIP + Container Pack

**Goal:** Deliver the most integration-heavy phase: PLC/MIP handshake for serialized assembly, BOM-validated consumption, serialized part tracking with hardware-interlock-bypass handling, container packing with per-tray position tracking, non-serialized line support, and the first AIM outbound call for `GetNextNumber`.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (foundation), Phase 2 (LotGenealogy consumption), Phase 3 (ProductionEvent), Phase 4 (Movement), Phase 5 (Split — rework may flow back through Machining).

**Status:** Blocked on Phases 1–5.

## Data Model Changes

**Migration `sql/migrations/versioned/0015_phase6_assembly.sql`:**

- Apply UJ-16 decision from Phase 0. Most likely outcome (option b + a): add `HardwareInterlockBypassed BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to both `Workorder.ProductionEvent` **and** `Lots.ContainerSerial`. Alternative: single location per Phase 0 choice.
- Add `Parts.ContainerConfig.ClosureMethodCodeId BIGINT NULL` FK to a new `Parts.ContainerClosureMethodCode` code table (seeded with: `Count`, `Weight`, `ManualClose`). OI-02 currently has a nullable `ClosureMethod NVARCHAR(20)` on `ContainerConfig`; this migration migrates that free-text column to a proper code-table FK. Backfill: existing rows with text value mapped to the new code; drop the old NVARCHAR column after backfill.
- Apply B10 outcome from Phase 0. If update-in-place was chosen for serial migration, create `Lots.ContainerSerialHistory` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Lots.ContainerSerialHistory (
    Id BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ContainerSerialId BIGINT NOT NULL FK → Lots.ContainerSerial,
    OldContainerId BIGINT NOT NULL FK → Lots.Container,
    NewContainerId BIGINT NOT NULL FK → Lots.Container,
    OldTrayId BIGINT NULL FK → Lots.ContainerTray,
    NewTrayId BIGINT NULL FK → Lots.ContainerTray,
    OldTrayPosition INT NULL,
    NewTrayPosition INT NULL,
    ChangeReason NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    ChangedByUserId BIGINT NOT NULL FK → Location.AppUser,
    TerminalLocationId BIGINT NOT NULL FK → Location.Location,
    ChangedAt DATETIME2(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSDATETIME()
);
```

- Seed `Parts.OperationTemplate` rows for `SerializedAssembly` and `NonSerializedAssembly` with their DataCollectionField sets.
- Seed `Audit.LogEventType` entries: `ConsumptionRecorded`, `SerialCreated`, `ContainerCreated`, `ContainerCompleted`, `AimGetNextNumberCalled`.

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

| Item | Fallback / Resolution |
|---|---|
| UJ-16 `HardwareInterlockBypassed` flag | Phase 0 decision — column(s) added in migration 0015. If unresolved, ship with both ProductionEvent and ContainerSerial columns (safest). |
| UJ-05 serial migration | Phase 0 decision — B10 rewritten. If update-in-place: `ContainerSerialHistory` table added. If void-and-recreate: no new table; `ContainerSerial_Add` + `ShippingLabel_Void` suffice. |
| OI-02 container closure | Fallback: count-based closure if `ContainerConfig.ClosureMethodCodeId` is Count or NULL; weight-based if Weight; manual close if ManualClose. `Container_Complete` checks the configured method. |
| UJ-17 vision vs barcode | Fallback: barcode canonical. If vision data returns a mismatch, auto-place a LOT hold (Phase 7) with reason `VisionMismatch` and supervisor override (re-auth required). |
| UJ-09 material verification | Fallback: BOM-based. Consumption validates the source LOT's ItemId matches an active `BomLine.ChildItemId` of the output's active `Bom`. |

## State & Workflow

### Serialized assembly line (5G0)

The line has a PLC running the assembly machine, a laser etcher for serial numbers, and a Zebra printer at the container close point. An MIP (Machine Integration Panel) exposes OPC tags that the Gateway script watches.

MIP tags (descriptive — actual addresses in `5GO_AP4_Automation_Touchpoint_Agreement.pdf`):

- `DataReady` — BIT; PLC sets to 1 when a part is ready for validation.
- `PartSN` — string; PLC writes the laser-etched serial, or `"NoRead"` if interlock bypassed.
- `PartValid` — BIT; MES writes 1 after successful validation.
- `HardwareInterlockEnable` — BIT; if 0, PLC proceeds without waiting for `PartValid`.
- `ContainerFull` — BIT (some lines); PLC signals when the container is at its physical capacity.

Gateway script `MipHandshakeWatcher` runs one instance per assembly line. On `DataReady` edge 0→1:

1. Read `PartSN` and `HardwareInterlockEnable`.
2. If `HardwareInterlockEnable=0`: call `SerializedPart_AcceptBypassed(@LineLocationId, @PartSN=NoRead, ...)` — creates a `SerializedPart` row with `HardwareInterlockBypassed=1`, no validation, emits InterfaceLog entry. Write `PartValid=1` (though the PLC won't wait).
3. Else (interlock enabled): call `SerializedPart_Validate(@LineLocationId, @PartSN, @ItemId, @SourceLotIds, ...)`. Proc validates:
   - `@PartSN` not already in `SerializedPart`.
   - `@PartSN` format matches expected pattern for this Item.
   - Source LOTs all match active BOM lines (material verification).
4. If valid: call `ConsumptionEvent_Record` (composite) to write:
   - `ConsumptionEvent` rows linking each source LOT piece consumed.
   - `LotGenealogy` CONSUMPTION rows.
   - `SerializedPart` row with the new serial.
   - `ContainerSerial_Add` row placing the serial in the active container's next tray position.
5. Write `PartValid=1` back to the PLC.
6. If the container is now full (by count, weight, or PLC `ContainerFull=1` signal): call `Container_Complete`. That proc calls `AimGetNextNumber` (Gateway script) → writes `AimShipperId` → triggers `ShippingLabel_Print` (Phase 7 delivers this proc; Phase 6 invokes its stub).

If validation fails: write `PartValid=0`. PLC rejects the part. FailureLog entry. Operator gets an alert on the Assembly Operator Screen.

### Non-serialized assembly line (6B2, RPY)

Simpler path. The PLC exposes `PartDisposition` (Pass/Fail) and `ContainerName`, not individual serials. The Gateway watcher treats each pass-disposition event as a count-increment:

1. On `PartDisposition=Pass` edge: call `ConsumptionEvent_Record` with `@ProducedPieceCount=1` and no serial number. `LotGenealogy` CONSUMPTION row without serial.
2. Increment the active container's count.
3. When count or weight closure threshold hit: `Container_Complete`.

Non-serialized lines don't create `SerializedPart` rows. They still create `Container`, `ContainerTray`, and `ShippingLabel` rows.

### Scale-driven container closure (OI-02)

If `ContainerConfig.ClosureMethodCodeId = Weight`, `Container_Complete` verifies the container's scale reading matches `ContainerConfig.TargetWeight ± tolerance`. The tolerance is a `ContainerConfig` attribute (Phase 6 adds it if Phase 0 resolves the spec). If outside tolerance: reject the close, show operator alert.

If `Count`: closure triggered when `ContainerTray.PieceCount` sum equals `ContainerConfig.TraysPerContainer * PartsPerTray`.

If `ManualClose`: operator presses a "Close Container" button; no automatic trigger.

### BOM-based material verification (UJ-09)

When a source LOT is scanned at the assembly line (or the PLC publishes it), the MES validates:

1. The line's output Item has an active Bom (`Bom.DeprecatedAt IS NULL AND Bom.PublishedAt IS NOT NULL`).
2. The source LOT's `ItemId` matches one of the `BomLine.ChildItemId` entries for that Bom.

If the source doesn't match: reject, hold the output LOT, alert operator (UJ-17 vision mismatch pattern reused).

### Sort Cage flow-back (preview — Phase 7 delivers)

Sort Cage can update `ContainerSerial` rows. In Phase 6's delivery, `ContainerSerial_Add` is the only write path. In Phase 7, the update/remove/history procs land. Phase 6 leaves the data model ready (including `ContainerSerialHistory` if chosen).

### `ConsumptionEvent_Record` proc (composite)

Signature:

```
Workorder.ConsumptionEvent_Record(
    @SourceLotId BIGINT,
    @ConsumedPieceCount INT,
    @ConsumedItemId BIGINT,
    @ProducedItemId BIGINT,
    @ProducedLotId BIGINT NULL,           -- For non-serialized into-Lot flows
    @ProducedContainerId BIGINT,
    @ProducedContainerTrayId BIGINT NULL,
    @ProducedSerialNumber NVARCHAR(100) NULL,
    @TrayPosition INT NULL,
    @HardwareInterlockBypassed BIT = 0,
    @LocationId BIGINT,
    @AppUserId BIGINT,
    @TerminalLocationId BIGINT
)
```

Sequence:

1. Validate params.
2. `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` on `@SourceLotId`.
3. Material verification (BOM check — UJ-09).
4. Insert `Workorder.ConsumptionEvent` row.
5. Call `Lots.LotGenealogy_RecordConsumption` (Phase 2) with the CONSUMPTION relationship.
6. Decrement `@SourceLotId` piece count by `@ConsumedPieceCount`. If count hits 0, update status to Closed via `Lot_UpdateStatus`.
7. If `@ProducedSerialNumber` is present: call `SerializedPart_Create` (internal) with `HardwareInterlockBypassed`. Then call `ContainerSerial_Add` with `@TrayPosition`.
8. Update `ContainerTray.PieceCount` += 1 (for serialized) or += `@ConsumedPieceCount` (for non-serialized pass-through). Update `Container` rollup counts if materialized.
9. Audit `LogEventType='ConsumptionRecorded'`.
10. Return `Status, Message, ConsumptionEventId, SerializedPartId (if any), ContainerSerialId (if any)`.

Target: 150–200 passing tests in suite 0018 (biggest phase, most branches).

## Phase 6 complete when

- [ ] Migration `0015_phase6_assembly.sql` applied: UJ-16 flag column(s) added; `ContainerClosureMethodCode` code table + FK; ContainerSerialHistory (if B10 update-in-place); operation templates seeded.
- [ ] All Assembly procs delivered: `ConsumptionEvent_Record`, `SerializedPart_Validate` + `_Create`, `Container_Create` + `_Complete`, `ContainerTray_Add`, `ContainerSerial_Add`, `ContainerSerial_RelocateInPlace` (if B10).
- [ ] All tests in `sql/tests/0018_PlantFloor_Assembly/` pass (target 150–200).
- [ ] `MipHandshakeWatcher`, `NonSerializedAssemblyWatcher`, `AimGetNextNumberCaller`, `AssemblyZebraDispatcher` Gateway scripts implemented against dev PLC simulator / AIM mock endpoint.
- [ ] Perspective Assembly Operator Screens (serialized + non-serialized variants) implemented.
- [ ] End-to-end on dev bench: operator scans source LOT → PLC simulator fires DataReady → MES validates, writes serial, fills tray → container auto-completes → AIM mock returns ShipperId → container shipping label prints.
- [ ] HardwareInterlockEnable=0 bypass path verified: NoRead serial accepted, bypass flag set on downstream rows.
- [ ] Vision mismatch simulation logs to InterfaceLog and alerts operator (auto-hold wiring deferred to Phase 7 after `HoldEvent_Place` ships).

# Phase 7 — Hold + Sort Cage + Shipping + AIM

**Goal:** Deliver the quality-supervisor and shipping workflows, plus the remaining AIM outbound integrations. Hold placement with multi-LOT support, Sort Cage re-containerization with serial migration (per Phase 0 pattern), shipping-label void/reprint, final ship gate, and truck manifest.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (foundation), Phase 2 (LOT lifecycle, labels), Phase 3 (reject / events), Phase 6 (Container + ContainerSerial + ShippingLabel scaffolding).

**Status:** Blocked on Phases 1–3 and 6.

## Data Model Changes

**Migration `sql/migrations/versioned/0016_phase7_hold_sort_shipping.sql`:**

- Seed `Audit.LogEventType` entries: `HoldPlaced`, `HoldReleased`, `ContainerHeld`, `ContainerReleased`, `ShippingLabelPrinted`, `ShippingLabelVoided`, `ContainerShipped`, `AimPlaceOnHoldCalled`, `AimReleaseFromHoldCalled`, `AimUpdateAimCalled`.
- Seed `Quality.HoldTypeCode` rows if not already: `Quality`, `CustomerComplaint`, `Precautionary`, `VisionMismatch` (from UJ-17 fallback).
- Apply any B10 (serial migration) schema deltas not already applied in Phase 6.
- Seed `Lots.PrintReasonCode` rows for shipping-label scenarios: `InitialShipping`, `ReprintDamaged`, `SortCageReIdentify`, `AimResync`.

**Tables used:** `Quality.HoldEvent`, `Quality.HoldTypeCode`, `Lots.Container`, `Lots.ContainerSerial`, `Lots.ContainerSerialHistory` (if B10), `Lots.ShippingLabel`, `Lots.LabelTypeCode`, `Lots.Lot`, `Lots.LotStatusHistory`, `Audit.*`.

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

| Item | Fallback / Resolution |
|---|---|
| UJ-05 Sort Cage migration | Phase 0 decision applied here. Write paths differ by choice. |
| UJ-17 vision handling | Auto-hold reason = `VisionMismatch`; supervisor override requires re-auth. |
| OI-02 closure affects Sort Cage | Re-containerized outputs re-apply closure method; if Weight, new scale reading required. |

## State & Workflow

### Hold placement (multi-LOT)

Quality supervisor Diane gets a call from Honda. She opens the Hold Management screen.

1. Diane filters LOTs (by Item `5G0`, date range yesterday 14:00–22:00, status = Good or Scrap). Multi-select available.
2. She selects 12 candidate LOTs. Clicks "Place on Hold".
3. Modal: select `HoldTypeCode` (`CustomerComplaint`), enter reason (`Honda dimensional concern, pending investigation`), re-authenticates.
4. Perspective iterates the selection, calling `HoldEvent_Place` for each:

```
Quality.HoldEvent_Place(
    @LotId, @HoldTypeCodeId, @NonConformanceId NULL (MVP: always NULL),
    @Reason NVARCHAR(500), @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)
```

5. Each call:
   - `Lot_AssertNotBlocked` — if already held, reject (B3 open-event invariant).
   - Insert `Quality.HoldEvent` row with `PlacedAt = SYSDATETIME()`, `ReleasedAt NULL`.
   - Call `Lot_UpdateStatus` → `Hold` (with internal no-op suppression for LOTs already Hold — edge case).
   - Audit `HoldPlaced`.

6. For each held LOT, Perspective also checks `Lots.Container` rows where `LotId = this LOT`. For each container not already shipped: call `Container_UpdateStatus → Hold` and trigger Gateway `AimPlaceOnHoldCaller` with the container's `AimShipperId`. AIM's ack is logged to `InterfaceLog`.
7. Result screen shows: 12 LOTs held, 3 containers flagged, AIM acknowledgements logged.

### Hold release

1. After investigation, Diane clears the hold. Hold Management screen lets her filter open holds and select the ones to release.
2. Perspective calls `HoldEvent_Release` per LOT:

```
Quality.HoldEvent_Release(
    @HoldEventId, @ReleaseRemarks NVARCHAR(500),
    @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)
```

3. Proc updates the `HoldEvent` row: `ReleasedByUserId`, `ReleasedAt = SYSDATETIME()`, `ReleaseRemarks`.
4. Proc calls `Lot_UpdateStatus` → `Good` (or whatever the pre-hold status was; captured by HoldEvent — but MVP fallback is always restore to `Good`).
5. For containers that were held: Perspective calls `Container_UpdateStatus → Complete` and Gateway `AimReleaseFromHoldCaller`.
6. Audit `HoldReleased`.

### Sort Cage re-containerization

Diane identifies that the issue is localized to cavity A of die 42 from yesterday's second shift. Three LOTs affected, two already in containers at dock.

1. **WIP LOT split** — she opens one LOT in LOT Detail, uses `Lot_Split` (Phase 2) to carve out the 12 suspect pieces. The suspect child's status → `Scrap` via `Lot_UpdateStatus`. Parent returns to `Good` if she releases its hold.

2. **Container unpacking and re-containerization** — for the two containers at the dock:
   - Diane moves the containers to the Sort Cage location (`Container_UpdateStatus` to Hold or leave held; update `CurrentLocationId` via a helper).
   - Opens Sort Cage Workflow screen for one container.
   - Screen shows the tray grid (from `ContainerSerial_List`). Each serial is selectable with Pass / Fail / Rework buttons.
   - Operator inspects each part. Marks some Pass, some Fail.
     - **Pass** → serial gets migrated to a new "good" output container.
     - **Fail** → serial's `SerializedPart` gets its `LotId` reassigned to a new Scrap LOT (created on-demand).
     - **Rework** → serial gets placed in a rework container that routes back through Machining.
   - Perspective tracks the decisions in session state until Diane "commits" the re-container.

3. **On commit** — one of two patterns per Phase 0 UJ-05:

   - **Pattern A (void-and-recreate):** Original ShippingLabel voided via `ShippingLabel_Void`; Gateway `AimUpdateAimCaller` calls AIM `UpdateAim(serial, previousSerial)` per Appendix L. The original `Container` status goes `Void`. New `Container` rows created for Good / Scrap / Rework outputs. New `SerializedPart` rows... no, same physical part — do we recreate? Likely we keep the same `SerializedPart` but move it to the new container via `ContainerSerial_Add`. The old `ContainerSerial` row stays (historical — container was voided, serial "left" when container was voided).
   - **Pattern B (update-in-place):** `ContainerSerial_RelocateInPlace` (Phase 6 proc) called per serial, with `@ChangeReason = 'SortCageSort'`, migrating to new container. `ContainerSerialHistory` rows capture old vs. new. Original container still exists as a historical record; a final `Container_Close` state may be Void, Complete, or a new status `Depleted`.

   Per Phase 0 decision, one of these is chosen. Plan convention B10 captures the specifics.

4. **New shipping labels** — for each new output container (Good ones), `ShippingLabel_Print` with `LabelTypeCode='Container'` and `PrintReasonCode='SortCageReIdentify'`. If the Good output container is ready to ship, Gateway `AimGetNextNumberCaller` gets a new ShipperId.

5. **AIM reconciliation** — per FRS Appendix L, `UpdateAim(serial, previousSerial)` is called for each serial that migrated. Gateway handles the sequence per Phase 0 decision.

### Shipping

The good containers — released from hold, re-sorted as needed — are loaded on the truck.

1. Shipping operator at the Shipping Dock scans each container's shipping label barcode.
2. Perspective calls `Container_Ship`:

```
Lots.Container_Ship(
    @ContainerId, @TruckId NVARCHAR(50) NULL, @ManifestId BIGINT NULL,
    @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)
```

3. Proc validates:
   - Container status = Complete (not Hold, not Void).
   - AimShipperId present (non-NULL).
   - Not already Shipped.
4. Update container status → Shipped. Update `CurrentLocationId` → Shipping Dock (or a "Shipped" abstract location).
5. Audit `ContainerShipped`.

A simple truck-manifest table may be added later; for MVP, Container_Ship records the `TruckId` on the container header and Perspective produces a printable manifest from a list of containers with the same TruckId.

### Re-auth for high-security actions

Placing holds, releasing holds, voiding labels, scrapping LOTs all require re-authentication per Phase 1's session model. The re-auth modal confirms the operator's identity for the specific action. No session-level state change.

# Phase 8 — Downtime + Shift Boundary (Parallel Track)

**Goal:** Capture machine downtime events (manual and PLC-driven), support late-binding reason assignment, capture warm-up / setup shot counts, and apply shift-boundary rules for open downtime continuity. Runs in parallel with Phases 2–7 as soon as Phase 1 foundation lands.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (foundation — Shift runtime, LOT core). No direct dependency on Phases 2–7.

**Status:** Blocked on Phase 1 only; a separate team can develop Phase 8 concurrently with Phases 2–7.

## Data Model Changes

**Migration `sql/migrations/versioned/0017_phase8_downtime_shift.sql`:**

- Seed `Audit.LogEventType` entries: `DowntimeStarted`, `DowntimeEnded`, `DowntimeReasonAssigned`, `ShiftBoundaryCarryover`.
- If not already present from Arc 1: seed `Oee.DowntimeSourceCode` rows (`Manual`, `PLC`). (These were seeded in Arc 1 Phase 8; verify.)
- If Phase 0 produced a `ShiftBoundaryCarryoverRuleCode` or similar code table, seed its rows here.

**Tables used:** `Oee.DowntimeEvent`, `Oee.DowntimeSourceCode`, `Oee.DowntimeReasonCode`, `Oee.DowntimeReasonType`, `Oee.Shift`, `Oee.ShiftSchedule`, `Audit.OperationLog`, `Audit.InterfaceLog` (PLC events).

## Open Items Affecting This Phase

| Item | Fallback / Resolution |
|---|---|
| UJ-10 shift boundary carryover | Phase 0 decision applied in `Shift_End` and in the boundary ticker. Fallback: leave open `DowntimeEvent` rows open across shift boundaries (no auto-close); supervisor can manually close if stale. |
| UJ-14 warm-up shots | Captured on `DowntimeEvent.ShotCount` when `DowntimeReasonType='Setup'`. Already seeded schema — Phase 8 ensures the procs honor it. |

## State & Workflow

### Manual downtime entry

Carlos's die sticks at 6:45am. He taps "Record Downtime" on the Die Cast screen's always-visible panel.

1. Modal opens with:
   - Machine name (pre-populated from terminal's zone).
   - Start time (pre-filled with current timestamp; editable backward within a reasonable window).
   - Reason picker — filtered to DowntimeReasonCodes whose `Area` matches this machine's parent Area.
   - Setup sub-form: if selected reason's `DowntimeReasonType='Setup'`, a `ShotCount` input appears (UJ-14).
   - Notes textarea.
2. He selects `EQ-DIE-STICK`, notes "die fouled", submits. Perspective calls `DowntimeEvent_Start`:

```
Oee.DowntimeEvent_Start(
    @LocationId, @DowntimeSourceCodeId=Manual, @DowntimeReasonCodeId,
    @ShotCount NULL, @StartedAt, @Remarks,
    @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)
```

3. Proc validates:
   - `Location` exists and is a Machine-type.
   - B3: no open DowntimeEvent already exists for this Location.
   - If reason provided, reason's Area matches machine's Area.
4. Insert row with `EndedAt NULL`, audit as `DowntimeStarted`.

### Ending downtime

At 6:57am Carlos clears the die. Taps "End Downtime" (same panel).

1. Confirmation modal: "End downtime EQ-DIE-STICK at 06:57? Notes?"
2. Submit. Perspective calls `DowntimeEvent_End(@DowntimeEventId, @EndedAt, @Remarks, @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)`.
3. Proc validates: event exists and is open; `@EndedAt > @StartedAt`.
4. If the active reason type = `Setup` and ShotCount was not captured, Perspective may prompt for ShotCount now (UJ-14).
5. Update `EndedAt`, append Remarks. Audit `DowntimeEnded`.

### PLC-driven downtime

The PLC on a machine exposes a `MachineStopped` tag. A per-machine Gateway script watches the edge.

1. Gateway `DowntimePlcWatcher` detects `MachineStopped=1`.
2. Calls `DowntimeEvent_Start(@LocationId, @DowntimeSourceCodeId=PLC, @DowntimeReasonCodeId=NULL, ...)` — reason NULL per B7 (late-binding).
3. Insert event. Audit.
4. Operator sees the event on their screen with a "Classify" button.
5. When operator selects a reason and submits: Perspective calls `DowntimeReasonCode_Assign(@DowntimeEventId, @DowntimeReasonCodeId, @ShotCount NULL, @AppUserId, @TerminalLocationId)`. Proc validates reason not already assigned; updates the row; audit.
6. On `MachineStopped=0` edge: Gateway calls `DowntimeEvent_End`. Reason may still be NULL — that's allowed per B7.

### Shift boundary carryover

At shift boundary (e.g., 14:00 Mon–Fri), the `ShiftBoundaryTicker` (Phase 1) fires. Per Phase 0's UJ-10 rule, one of these behaviors applies:

- **Close open downtimes at shift end.** Any open `DowntimeEvent` rows have `EndedAt = shift's ActualEnd` written; new events started for the new shift if the machine is still down (the PLC watcher will restart on the next edge).
- **Carry open downtimes across.** Open `DowntimeEvent` rows stay open. When they eventually end, they may span shift boundaries. OEE calculation (FUTURE) would proration by shift.
- **Hybrid — open downtime associated with the starting shift.** Assign `ShiftId` on the DowntimeEvent when started; reports group by ShiftId regardless of clock time.

Phase 0 chooses. Plan text codifies. Phase 8 delivers the behavior the chosen rule specifies.

### Warm-up / setup shot capture

Setup-type downtime (tooling changeover) involves warm-up shots. Per UJ-14:

1. When starting a Setup-type downtime, the operator may capture the initial `ShotCount` (or 0).
2. Warm-up shots run during downtime. They're captured separately from production shots — either as `ProductionEventValue.WarmupShotCount` on the associated Die Cast template (Phase 3 provides the field), or as an incremented counter on the open DowntimeEvent.
3. When ending the Setup downtime, the final `ShotCount` is recorded on the DowntimeEvent. Good production shots that follow are written via normal `ProductionEvent_Record` calls.

### Supervisor dashboard

`Supervisor Dashboard` view shows per-location per-shift:

- Open downtime events.
- Unclassified (reason NULL) downtime events.
- Total downtime duration in current shift.
- Production event count and piece count totals.

Drill-down from dashboard opens event lists for export / review. (Full OEE calculations are FUTURE — this dashboard is the MVP approximation.)

## API Layer

## Gateway Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Trigger | External System | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DowntimePlcWatcher` (one per machine with PLC integration) | Watches `MachineStopped` or equivalent tag; calls `DowntimeEvent_Start` on rising edge, `DowntimeEvent_End` on falling edge. | OPC tag edges | PLC (TOPServer) | `InterfaceLog` entries |
| `ShiftBoundaryTicker` (delivered Phase 1, extended here) | Phase 8 extends the Phase 1 ticker to invoke `DowntimeEvent_CarryAcrossShift` per Phase 0 rule. | 60s timer | — | `InterfaceLog` for carryover decisions |

## Perspective Views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Downtime Entry (embedded panel on station screens) | Always-visible Record Downtime / End Downtime / Classify Event actions. |
| Supervisor Dashboard | Per-machine per-shift downtime counts, durations, unclassified flags. Drill into event lists. |
| Downtime Event List | Filterable list with export. |
| Downtime Event Detail | Single event — timeline, reason, shots, remarks, edit (re-auth required). |

## Test Coverage

New test suite at `sql/tests/0020_PlantFloor_Downtime_Shift/`:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `010_DowntimeEvent_Start.sql` | Creates open row; B3 rejects duplicate open; rejects if Location not a Machine; Setup type with ShotCount stored. |
| `020_DowntimeEvent_End.sql` | Closes event; rejects if EndedAt < StartedAt; rejects if already ended. |
| `030_DowntimeReasonCode_Assign.sql` | Assigns reason to unclassified event; rejects overwrite; rejects Area mismatch. |
| `040_DowntimeEvent_carryover_closeAtEnd.sql` (rule A) | Shift_End closes open events when rule = CloseAtEnd. |
| `050_DowntimeEvent_carryover_carryOpen.sql` (rule B) | Shift_End leaves open events; event can span boundary. |
| `060_DowntimeEvent_carryover_associateWithStart.sql` (rule C) | ShiftId captured at Start; never updated by boundary. |
| `070_Warmup_ShotCount_capture.sql` | UJ-14: Setup downtime event captures ShotCount; non-Setup rejects ShotCount silently (ignored or enforced NULL per design). |

Target: 60–90 passing tests in suite 0020.

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from this plan — handled elsewhere or deferred:

- **OEE Snapshot calculation.** `Oee.OeeSnapshot` table exists in the data model as FUTURE scope. No Phase is dedicated to it; no stored procs, no Gateway scripts. Post-MVP workstream.
- **PD Reports replacement.** The four legacy Productivity Database reports (Die Shot, Rejects, Downtime, Production) are a separate Reporting workstream driven from the data captured here. Ignition Reporting module or an equivalent tool will consume the `ProductionEvent`, `RejectEvent`, `DowntimeEvent`, and `Shift` tables directly.
- **Macola integration.** FUTURE — not in this plan.
- **Intelex integration.** FUTURE — NCM/Failure Analysis remains in Intelex separately.
- **Pixel-level Perspective mockups and Perspective JSON project exports.** Functional view descriptions only. Mockup production, if done, is a parallel workstream.
- **Bit-level OPC tag addresses and PLC ladder logic.** See `reference/5GO_AP4_Automation_Touchpoint_Agreement.pdf` and FRS Appendix C.
- **Production-grade PLC firmware changes.** Assumed complete by PLC integrator before Phase 6 commissioning.
- **Dedicated `Parts.Die` + `Parts.DieLifeEvent` tables.** Deferred unless Phase 0 escalates OI-10. Default is LocationAttribute-based shot counts.
